https://library.brown.edu/pdfs/BDH_1968_04_23.pdf,Brown Daily Herald,N,Y,4/23/68,Spring Boycott: Whither the Faculty?,"Terry Schwadron, Peter Warren",,576,"A balmy, sunny Friday afternoon, the beginning of Spring Weekend. So who's going to class anyway? But the concerned never sleep. Those damn activists have scheduled an International Student Strike of classes for one day that no one is planning to attend class anyway. So much the better. I can sleep late without fear of being marked absent. Or can I? Members of the faculty may react negatively to the use of such a boycott of class to express student concern about ""issues facing the world community,"" and to define "" the role of national liberation movements."" As Anthony Molho, history professor commented, ""I'm personally fairly sympathetic to the thinking behind such a strike, though I'm not sure that I agree with holding a strike; their sentiments could probably be expressed better otherwise."" Professor Edward Honig, chairman of the English department, outline the dilemma facing him: ""I would be in sympathy with such a strike. It's a conflict between two things--personal conscience and as an administrator. With regard to the latter, I wouldn't penalize a student who participated."" His sentiments were echoed in part by C. Peter Magrath, political science professor, who said when asked about the possibility of non-attendance at Friday's classes, ""I'm not particularly in favor of it [the strike] but I won't penalize anyone who isn't there."" The announced plans of the established Ad Hoc committee which is coordinating activities at Brown in conjunction with the International Strike call for workshops and seminars to take place in the morning with a mass speak-out/teach-in scheduled for the afternoon. Boycotting of classes is a voluntary action, according to the Ad Hoc committee, although spokesmen for the group stressed that they would not encourage striking of classes just for the sake of cutting class (BDH 4/16). Some schools have reportedly cancelled classes, although Columbia has scheduled a mass rally for noontime and is discouraging the boycotting of classes. According to representatives of the Columbia Spectator, some professions will call off classes but otherwise normal attendance at classes is expected. The Moratorium Coalition which sponsored a March 13 boycott of classes to protest the War asked the students not to cut their classes. Joel Kramer, president of the Harvard Crimson, reported to the Herald, ""Absolutely nothing is being done at Harvard about the boycott. We'll be holding classes and expect full attendance. the boycott is just not being talked about at Harvard at all."" Dean Gordon R. Dewart was unaware that there would be a boycott and thought that only a teach-in was planned. ""There is no university policy on the boycott,"" he said, "" and those who use up permitted cuts will not be excused."" Several faculty members showed concern about the completion of planned work before clearing the way for legal non-attendance of classes. Dr. Jonathan P. Green, teacher of Biology II, who is administering an hour examination in that course this Friday, thought that the boycott was cancelled because a marked absence could point up the proximity of Spring Weekend and not the conviction of the absentees. He is now, however, ""considering alternatives"" but has ""reached no decision."" Some faculty members seemed almost indignant at the idea of boycotting classes for such a cause. Sociology professor C. P. Wolf told the Herald he was ""apathetic,"" and ""would be in the country"" as he had no classes scheduled. When asked if he would cancel classes if he had one scheduled, he replied, ""Certainly not."""
https://library.brown.edu/pdfs/BDH_1968_04_30.pdf,Brown Daily Herald,Y,Y,4/30/68,Violence Rages at Columbia,"James Baker, Steve Wolinsky",,654,"At Brown students slept through their Friday morning classes in observance of the International Student Strike. At Yale a group of stalwart naturalists guarded two trees on the Cross Campus to block their removal by bulldozers who were landscaping the area for an extension of a library. Columbia University in New York City, however, experienced something more than the weekend activism students have come to expect on this campus. aLte Friday afternoon as 700 demonstrators defied police and administrators at Columbia by refusing to relinquish their hold on five campus buildings, city policemen sealed off the university and occupied those buildings which had not already been taken over by student protestors. At 1:50 p.m., H. Rapp Brown and Stokely Carmichael suddenly appeared on the steps of Hamilton Hall where Negro activists had held captive for 23 hours Henry S. Coleman, Acting Dean of the College. Brown declared that the demonstrators, who were ""fighting against the racist policies of this university"" were to be joined by local Negroes who would ""deal with Columbia University. . . ."" A short time later Grayson Kirk, President of the University, ordered police to take action to clear the occupied buildings. The police moved in on Low Library and began pushing and clubbing the members of the faculty who had positioned themselves in front of that building to prevent the forcible eviction of the demonstrating students within. After the injury of one teacher required his hospitalization, a faculty delegation prevailed upon President Kirk to call off the police. As of last night, students were still in control of Hamilton Hall, and four other buildings, including the President's office in the Low Library, where they had apparently photographed his correspondence with the Institute for Defense Analysis. By Saturday, police had stopped demonstrators from moving freely in and out of the buildings they held although provisions and messages from outside were still allowed to reach them. On Tuesday, April 23, the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and the Columbia Student Afro-American Society called for the strike against the university administration which led to the seizure of parts of the campus. Paul Rockwell, an SDS member, said Wednesday night that the strike had been ""forced"" by the university's refusal to respond to the earlier, peacefully-articulated demands of the two groups. The group of protesting students, whose number had grown to 600 by yesterday afternoon, cite as their primary grievance the plans to construct a new gymnasium in Morningside Park -- a predominantly Negro residential area. This policy as been interpreted by the SDS and Afro-American Society as representing a ""racist encroachment"" on the Harlem Community on the part of Columbia. The scope of the students' demands has widened considerably after a full week of direct confrontation between the protesters and the university. Included are the following: _æ¢ The university must halt construction of the gymnasium in Morningside Park; _æ¢ The university must end its association with the Institute for Defense Analysis -- a consortium of twelve universities working in conjunction with the government; _æ¢ The university must lift its ban on indoor demonstrations; _æ¢ The university must end the prohibition imposed on six students involved in an earlier anti-IDA demonstration; _æ¢ The university must grant amnesty to all students taking part in the current demonstrations. Although President Kirk, in a conciliatory gesture, announced that work on the construction of the gymnasium had been temporarily halted following a request by Mayor Lindsay, Dr. Kirk has been firm in his refusal to surrender the disciplinary powers of his office to a committee of students, faculty, and administrators which could lead to a general amnesty. Last night the deadlock continued as the Ad Hoc Faculty Committee rejected a peace plan proposed by Dr. Kirk. The situation was comparatively quiet yesterday, except for a brief clash which occurred as demonstrators tried to smash their way through a wall of students who had lined up outside in opposition to the SDS."
https://library.brown.edu/pdfs/BDH_1968_05_01.pdf,Brown Daily Herald,N,Y,5/1/68,Police Called at Columbia Protestors Out of Building,Jeffrey Blumenfeld,,740,"Violence on the Columbia University campus reached new levels yesterday as the police, called in by President Grayson Kirk, descended on the demonstrators at about 3:00 a.m., and managed in two hours with frequent use of force, to clear them from the buildings which they had been occupying for six days. As of late yesterday afternoon, the Columbia Spectator said, police reported approximately 620 students arrested. Jeff Arsham, a staff member of the Spectator, confirmed that about 135 students have been treated for injuries, moistly head and face wounds, resulting from police clubs and black jacks. NO CLUBS, BLACKJACKS The administration, calling in the police, gave instruction that no clubs were to be taken into University buildings; however, allowed to take blackjacks with them as they forced their away into the buildings to evict the students. A spokesman for the demonstrators reported that there had been some vandalism of President Kirk's office when it was first entered by the students last week, but they had since made efforts to clean up the room. Another spokesman for the Spectator, who asked to remain anonymous, asserted that police had used axes and crowbars to force their way into the Presidential offices. EXTENT OF FORCE Mr. Arsham, speaking from incidents he had witnessed, felt that there were ""many instances where the police were using unprovoked force, to an extent totally unnecessary to get the job done."" In describing demonstrators' reactions to the police as ""varied,' Mr. Arsham noted that some students merely walked out of the buildings when asked, and were not arrested, while others resisted non-violently, being dragged out, and still others fought back. Those who fought the police, he said, met with respondent force, and were charged with resisting arrest. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the Ad Hoc Faculty Committee, which Monday night rejected a peace plan proposed by President Kirk, released a resolution condemning the administration_æ_s handling of the situation, charging that the administration had been as intransigent as the students in its actions. The Ad Hoc Committee gave the administration oa ""no vote of confidence, "" and called for the resignation of President Kirk. During the Ad Hoc Committee deliberations, according to the accounts of Mr. Arsham, who witnessed the incident, there was a crowd of three to four hundred students outside the room in which the meeting was taking place, demonstrating in favor of the committee and calling for President Kirk's resignation. GENERAL STRIKE CALLED Van Pellegrom, Columbia Student Council president, also called for the resignation of President Kirk, and, in addition, for a general student strike. (Since yesterday's classes had been called off, there were few students, aside from the demonstrators, on the campus, and so student reaction to the strike call has been difficult to estimate.) Police continue to occupy the campus, and are guarding all gates, as they have been for the past four days, barring entrance to all but campus residents. Both spokesmen for the Spectator described the campus as ""under a state of seige."" An Associated Press story, widely circulated in yesterday's late papers, noted that a crowd of approximately 2,000 bystanders gathered during the early morning police action, and went on to note that ""police used nightsticks freely in breaking up the large crowd."" It was also stated in the AP story that ""they bystanders clashed with police after the last of the demonstrators had been taken away."" TRUSTEES: 'DEAL FIRMLY' The Columbia Board of Trustees, which has been consistently urging President Kirk to deal firmly with the demonstrators, and which may well have been as influential as the mass-media-aroused public opinion, according to the Spectator spokesman, in convincing him to call in the police, had made no official comment on the incident as of late yesterday afternoon. A similar quiet proceeded from the President. Mr. Arsham stated that, before police were called in, the majority of student opinion seemed to be running against the demonstrators as they continued to occupy the five campus buildings and to reject various administration proposals for a solution. He felt, however, that ""the use of police force has alienated many of the students who would have supported the administration."" Spectator spokesmen replied with a ""no comment"" when queried about widely-circulated news accounts which claimed that students had photographed President Kirk's correspondence with the Institute for defense Analysis. There was no official announcement, as of late yesterday, with regard to punitive measures to be taken by the administration."
https://library.brown.edu/pdfs/BDH_1968_05_01.pdf,Brown Daily Herald,N,N,5/1/68,Disorder at Columbia,None listed,,336,"During the past week violence has raged on the Columbia University campus. Some would contend that the form of proÇ_test chosen by the student demonstrators was necessitated by the administration_æ_s unwillingness to listen to reason, and that the riots have raised issues which would not otherwise have received as much attention. While this may be true, the methodolgy of the protesters is not to be condoned. Civil disobedience has its place, and at times it is necessary, but it must always be accompanied by a willingness to accept punishment. Many of the civil disobedients at Columbia, as evidenced by their recent unreasonableness, their almost gratuitous rejection of all attempts at recÇ_onciliation, and their non-pacific resistÇ_ance to arrest, have shown themselves unÇ_willing to accept the consequences of their disobedience. In addition, there is a point beyond which a protest demonstration passes into wanton invasion and destruction of priÇ_vate property. While those involved may argue that their actions were justified by previous and continuing inequities, such actions serve only to alienate those sympathetic with the stated goals yet antipaÇ_thetic to the chosen course. The protesters who, as of late MonÇ_day night, still retained control of the five seized buildings were judged unreasonable by a growing number of their fellow stuÇ_dents, who felt that they had crossed from justified civil disobedience into gratuitous lawlessness. Their refusal to relinquish control left the administration with no choice, in face of growing pressure from the trustees and the public, but to call in the police. The summoning of policemen to deal with civil disorder, as proven by last sumÇ_mer_æ_s riots as well as by the Columbia incident, necessarily precipitates a degree of unprovoked and unnecessary violence. Even with adequate training in operations of this nature, policemen cannot reasonÇ_ably be expected to be able to estimate and use only that degree of force deemed _æ_proper,_æ a moot point in itself. Yet deÇ_spite the difficulties and reality of the situation, the violence exhibited by the police yesterday morning is also not to be condoned."
https://library.brown.edu/pdfs/BDH_1968_05_01.pdf,Brown Daily Herald,N,N,5/1/68,Order at Brown,None listed,,439,"Incidents such as the state of seige curÇ_rently in existence on the Columbia campus prompt serious consideration of the administration-student relationship at Brown. And Brown shows up well in this light. While there has been in the past _æ and no doubt will be in the future _æ critiÇ_cism of the _æ_lack of communication,_æ much of which has been and will be jusÇ_tified, there is also much at Brown to be commended. While there are problems on this campus which should not be overÇ_looked, Brown is, to a commendable exÇ_tent, a forward-looking institution. One of the precipitating factors in the Columbia demonstrations was a demand from the students for revision of a disciÇ_plinary system which was felt to be authÇ_oritarian. The same issue was raised on the Brown campus, and discussed in these pages, last year. The response from the administration, and the reaction by the student body, were, however, quite differÇ_ent. President Heffner_æ_s appointment of the Magrath Committee, and the commitÇ_tee_æ_s subsequent efforts, resulted in a sysÇ_tem for dealing with disciplinary cases which, in theory at least, signaled a signifÇ_icant advance. For the past several weeks, the ad hoc committee on Negro educational policy at Harvard has been pressing for the perÇ_manent addition to the Harvard curricuÇ_lum of courses in Negro history. Several times, the group has submitted lists of demands to the administration, and each time the demands have been rejected, only to be revised and resubmitted. At present, the negotiations on the question are at a stand-still. Brown_æ_s history department, in response to internal discussion as well as to a request from the Afro-American Society, began deliberations on this topic in February, resulting in a proposal to the Curriculum Committee in March, and, last week, the approval by the committee of the addition of History 166 to the curÇ_riculum. The exchange was conducted as reasoned discussion between two conÇ_cerned parties rather than through the submission and rejection of ultimatums. Not all of Brown_æ_s problems have been solved. But the progress just discussed inÇ_dicates that there is a methodology for the discussion of problems on this campus which is thankfully more rational, and certainly more effective, than the methodÇ_ology recently tried at Columbia, and elseÇ_where. Rational discussion and reasoned deÇ_bate, through the willingness of the adÇ_ministration to discuss problems and through the willingness of the students to trust the discussion process, have earned a place in administration-student dealings which is well-deserved and much to be adÇ_mired. This process is at times slow-movÇ_ing, at times frustrating, and always diffiÇ_cult. But recent advances on this campus have shown that it is the most desirable, and a most effective, process for change."

The tragedy of this week at Columbia, the tragedy of a great university dismembered into warring camps, is the tragedy which awaits Princeton and every university which refuses to provide meaningful institutional channels for effective student participation in de-cision-making. Columbia's administration had complete control of that university. There was no recognized means by which student opinion could make itself felt. There also was no faculty senate to express the collective opinion of the faculty. The administration left students no choice. If their views were to be heard, they would have to let the administration, which had refused them peaceful channels, feel the power of student opinion expressed through force. And in refusing to establish real political channels the administration also left themselves no choice. When students barricaded themselves into the university's buildings, what should have been a peaceful political issue became a test of strength. If the administration accepts student demands, they lose control of the university, and if the administration forcibly evicts the students there could be prolonged violence and mass faculty resignations which might destroy Columbia. No purely peaceful alternative was available. The demonstration is designed at least in part to create such an alternative. A peaceful demonstration earlier in the year against IDA had resulted only in the suspension of six students and no effective action. A demonstration sufficient to attract wide outside attention was necessary to force the administration into considering student demands. Occupying the buildings got such recognition. As Columbia's trustees' statement of Friday indicates, only the request of Mayor Lindsay caused the university to temporarily halt the gym construction which is the main target of the demonstration. That request would probably not have come without the tactics used. ' The situation created by the administration's long history of unresponsiveness leaves the university only three options. They can grant formal amnesty to the protesters and demonstrate that they have lost control of their university. They can call in the police and risk injuries, faculty resignations, property damage and further unrest which might necessitate occupation of die campus by police until the end of the year. These are unacceptable. There is one alternative left at this time. The administration must accept the proposals of a faculty group--proposals which would give the faculty control of discipline and a guaranteed voice in all future administrative decisions. These proposals offer Columbia the only hope she has of escaping a final violent confrontation and escaping with some modicum of face. But it is clear that, however the present crisis is resolved. Columbia must now commit itself to establishing an effective student voice in university decisions. The collapse of Columbia must be recognized for what it is _æ and it has implications for every college across the country. Columbia has fallen into anarchy because its administration refused to recognize the fundamental rights of students and faculty to control, in part, the destinies of the community of which they are a part. In light of the recent Princeton trustees' rejections of student demands on parietals, South Africa and UGA control over student social life, The Princetonian hopes that the trustees and_ the administration here meditate long and hard on this tragic week at Columbia."

The administration, meanwhile, announced that today's classes have been cancelled, indicating that the protesters will be secure in the occupied buildings until tonight at least. In one of yesterday's most dramatic events, members of an antistrike coalition cut off food supplies to student protesters in the library. The strikers, inspired by the Students for a Democratic Society, were maintaining their positions in five separate locations on campus, including the Low Library offices of Columbia president Grayson L. Kirk. Faculty members continued last night to line the grass below the occupied second floor offices. At 5 p.m. they were joined in their vigil by nearly 100 members of the vehemently anti-strike Majority Coalition. The members of the coalition (the jocks"") then marched to Low and lined up outside a long row of knee-high bushes, stretching in front of the besieged offices. Inside the offices, the 75 protesters who have occupied Low since Friday were in the midst of a strategy conference, which originally had been intended to lay-out a strict procedure for action in the case that the university called the police to evacuate the buildings as many feared. At 7:35 p.m. a student attempting to bring food to the strikers' window was foiled by the Majority Coalition blockade. Protesters late last night were weary but still well-organized, and defections were limited. In the math building they were picking up police conversations on the sidewalk with sensitive microphones. In Fayerweather Hall the SDS announced that a couple had been married during the strike. NEW YORK_æColumbia is a torn, campus, playing stage to a drama that threatens a tragic ending to a comedy of errors. As of 9 last night, students were occupying five barricaded buildings across this 28-acre asphalt campus in the heart of West Harlem. Their position was being threatened by the possibility of a university call for police to move in and forcibly empty the ""liberated"" buildings. Grayson Kirk, president of the university, has ruled out an amnesty for the hundreds of students involved in the protest. His stand has received the support of Columbia's Board of Trustees, its College Alumni Association and scores of faculty and students. Amnesty has become the strikers' seventh demand, supplementing the original six that cast Columbia into this turmoil. Hordes of police were stationed around Columbia, summoned by the university Friday morning. The entire campus was cordoned off with admittance _æthrough the wide black gates on Broadway and Amsterdam avenues_ærestricted to Barnard and Columbia students and faculty. The ""liberated"" buildings contained about 650 people_æColumbia and Barnard students and a sprinkling of outsiders. In the massive Low Memorial Library, where the protesters occupied the suite of deans' offices (including that of President Kirk), white arm-banded faculty members were on guard to protect the protesters from a rush by anti-protest students -cti._.Ht, and _hr>se in f_HT* going in or out as they please. It was the only one of the five buildings in which the protesters did not have free access in and out. Since the students have barricaded all doors, the windows have become standard entrances. The group occupying Hamilton Hall was entirely black. The whites who had originally been inside left when the blacks' organization, Students' Afro-American Society, made it clear that it wished to hold the hall on its own. No animosity exists between the black and white factions of the protesters. Mark Rudd, chairman of Columbia's Students for a Democratic Society, the force behind the entire protest, passed the segregated occupation of Hamilton off as ""a division of labor, nothing more."" Rudd, a 20-year-old junior who created a flurry here with a three week visit to Cuba a few months ago, has become the symbol of the protest. It was Rudd's spur-of-the-moment decision to attempt a takeover of Low Library Tuesday in the midst of an SDS protest against the Institute for Defense Analyses and the controversial Morningside Park gym that prompted the mass Columbia rebellion and counterrebellion. The voice of the counter-rebellion is the Majority Coalition, an ad hoc group formed Wednesday after 2,000 students (Columbia University has a total enrollment of 17,545) signed an anti-SDS petition. The Coalition, which includes many of the athletes on this campus, is radically anti-Rudd. Paul Vilardi '68, a spokesman for the Coalition, spoke to the press Friday night before a meeting with the Student Strike Coordinating Committee, an ad hoc group closely related to SDS, and also under Rudd's control. ""I don't expect a thing,"" Vilardi said pessimistically. ""All those SDS guys will want to do is sit around and talk."" Nothing came out of the talks. Conveniences of home All five of the halls were barred to outsiders, including the press. However, some iron-protesters did manage to get in every hall except Hamilton. The groups were remarkably well organized. In Fayerweather Hall, a Barnard sophomore who was acting as one of the head cooks said on Saturday she had a menu planned out through Sunday night. Breakfast, lunch and dinner were being served on a strict time schedule, with the food being prepared in a small kitchen normally used for Fayerweather social events. In the basement, 200 of Fayerweather's 300 inhabitants were regularly attending meetings run in a lecture hall according to parliamentary procedure. The meetings, running all day and late into the night, dealt with all aspects, philosophical and mundane, of the protesters' existence. Also in the basement, a woman doctor was standing in a small classroom by a table covered with plastic bandages, bottles of aspirin, m enormous jar of sodium bicarbonate and a paper cup filled with vitamins. The doctor, who is studying for m advanced degree at Columbia's School of Public Health, said there _æ¢vere five other doctors at work in makeshift infirmaries for the protesters. ""Be Clean"" signs were pasted around Fayerweather stairwells, and most of the protesters were careful to observe the warning. Supplies for protesters  Students carrying boxes of food, oaper towels, toilet paper, medical supplies, blankets and other necessities can be seen steadily pouring out of SSCC headquarters in Ferris Booth Hall, the campus center that houses the facilities of all student activities. The biggest incident to occur over the weekend happened shortly after midnight on Saturday when a half dozen SDS members attempted to get past the faculty members on guard in front of Low and join the other protesters inside. The faculty foiled four of the chargers, but two made it up to the low second-floor ledge and into a window. A bitter verbal exchange between the faculty and the protesters who had gathered on the ledge ensued. Faculty members rushed to Low from a meeting being held in a hall on the other side of the campus, and formed a line three-deep along the grass in front of the Low windows. Two hundred students quickly gathered. The faculty eventually quelled the rising tide of catcalls it was drawing; the crowd broke up after a plea by a student for cooperation with the teachers' demands to disperse. The remaining SDS students were not allowed in. Weekend quiet The campus was generally calm this weekend, following the appearances of Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap Brown that threatened for an uneasy while to blow the lid off Columbia's fuming kettle. Crowds materialized out of thin air around the campus. A crowd of over 200 formed spontaneously Saturday afternoon to watch a group of tipsy, half-naked freshmen perched atop Columbia's revered sundial issue an appeal for Indian power. The appeal, a spoof of Both factions in the student dispute, was made by the Pupils for an Indian Society (P. 1.5.). They preferred their own six demands, which included a call to ""Give Manhattan back to the Indians"" and ""Complete Amnesty for Geronimo."" Barnard rally On Friday night, Barnard girls staged a pro-strike rally outside the gates of their own school. The rally consisted of each girl holding a lighted candle stub and giggling happily at the inquisitive passers-by. Other Barnard girls were giving far less token support as part of the student forces inside the five ""liberated"" buildings."

SDS asked Harry A. Marmion, a Washington attorney whom the university sponsored as a draft counselor yesterday in MurrayDodge, to sign their petition calling for full-time counseling of undergraduates. Mr. Marmion refused to sign the petition, stating that he was ""a guest of the university and would not feel free to discuss university affairs."" The lawyer, however, did admit that he lacked sufficient knowledge to advise students on such' problems as emigration to Canada and political resistance. According to spokesman Douglas P. Seaton '69, SDS ""is not simply seeking concessions on specific demands but a change in the power ' relations within the university."" SDS will canvass all dormitories this week to gauge student support for possible protests on recent trustee decisions on parietals, IDA and investment policy. According to SDS spokesman Richard P. Fried '68, the group feels that ""If all official channels of communication are closed off, other means may have to be tried."" The group reportedly is considering a sit-on at Nassau Hall."

Mr. Goheen, in analyzing the week-long protest that has paralyzed the school, called it ""a serious and tragic coming together of events for a great university. ""I wouldn't say it couldn't happen here,"" he stated, ""but I would hope that the situation would be different enough to preclude the university's being completely stalled in this way."" He pointed out that the tensions between Columbia and the community around it and between blacks and whites, on top of the other issues involved, created ""a devilish mix"" of problems. When questioned about contingency planning at Princeton for such a development, Mr. Goheen stated: ""We're not a police state; we don't have any riot plans. ""I would like to believe that most of the students are aware that just because you can't get everything that you Want, you don't have to throw a temper tantrum,"" he said. He also stressed the complex nature of the amnesty question, in differentiating between the Afro-American protest and the SDS protest and the treatment that was appropriate for each. ""We need to make an extra effort and be super-tolerant"" in the case of the Afro-American protest, he said, because of the many injustices performed against the black people. ""I think the white students need to expect a more normal treatment and I think normal treatment can't mean amnesty,"" he concluded. "

He was the last person to gain free access to the suite and the last to get out. His story follows.) NEW YORK _æ As far as I could tell, I was the only non-Columbia, non-Barnard student there. The anti-strike Majority Coalition continued to prevent anyone from even getting near the second-floor windows where the protesters were waiting. A string of approximately 200 students, most in coats and ties, stayed on watch' throughout the night. They came at 5 p.m. Sunday. Inside, the major problem was I food. Before I left Sunday night at 9, two girls in a large closet serving as a kitchen were preparing supper for the protesters. Their supplies were limited. One girl said, ""We'll have no trouble about the food for tonight, but tomorrow .. ."" Her voice simply trailed off. There is a report now that a number of the protesters have gotten dysentery, apparently from that supper I just missed. The spirit of the group was high. I counted 52 guys and 45 girls. The protesters roam in and out of the three rooms at will. In Fayerweather Hall, I had been thrown out when people found I was a reporter. In Low, no one challenged me, knew who I was, or had any inkling that I had not been there from the start. I got in at 4 Sunday afternoon by jumping a low hedge that surrounds the library and walking to one of the easily-scaled metal gratings that cover the ground-floor windows. About a half-dozen white-arm-banded faculty members were standing in front of the windows in their self-declared police role. Two were talking within 15 feet of the spot where I approached. They looked for a second, and then went on talking. One of the demonstrators was sitting on the two-foot-wide ledge outside the second-floor windows. I asked if I could come up. He knelt down to give me a hand, and pulled me onto the ledge. I entered a room that was nearly deserted. Until last' Tuesday it had been the office of Mrs. Helen King, secretary and receptionist for President Kirk. All the furniture except a few cushioned chairs had been moved into another room on the left, where the doors were completely barricaded into a tight wedge by upturned desks, chairs, books, and everything else available. The far room was being used as a sleeping room for the strikers. Planks from the wooden filing shelves that surrounded two of the walls in Mrs. King's office had been removed and thrown together in a pile. The kitchen has been converted om a typists' storeroom. Packets of Sphinx paper, typewriter ribbons, pads and the like still occupy the shelves on the right side of the room. On the left, the shelves were filled with the dwindling supply of food -jars of coffee and peanut butter, cad, some eggs, and a large variety of condiments. Food was disappearing. At one point during the afternoon, the protesters had talked of using oranges as missiles to throw at cops in the event they attempted to storm Low, this is generally feared. The food is now all but eaten. Someone had brought the strikers a huge box of lollipops. No one ate them. Most of the protesters were in a strategy meeting in Kirk's office, the room to the right of Mrs. King's office. When I entered, the group was in the middle .of discussion on what to do in the event the police used tear gas to drive them out. Two girls had learned from a doctor how to counteract Mace, ah aerosol spray often used in riot control, and were asked to teach the techniques to -the entire group. Most were dressed in shirts and jeans; a few of the girls wore skirts. Nearly all wore their hair long and straight. Many of the men were bearded. The Low group is entirely white, except for one boy and one girl. In a small foyer off Kirk's office, a door led to a bathroom in which the Low protesters have stocked paper towels, toothpaste, brushes and other essentials. The Strikers also have Kirk's enamelled shower with sliding glass doors at their disposal. It is now rumored, however, that the toilet in the suite is plugged. The phone in Kirk's office was not working, but the one in Mrs. King's office was. It was in nearly constant use, with messages being relayed to and from Low and the other ""liberated"" buildings, and from the student strike committee across campus in Ferris Booth Hall. By 5 p.m. the meeting was still in an orderly discussion about how to greet police. For instance, a minority favored attempting to knock the police from the ledges if they tried to come in through the windows. In Mrs. King's office, a radio was carrying a report by WKCR-FM, the student station, that the Majority Coalition was gathering to encircle Low. The protesters were unfazed at the prospect. While we watched, the coalition ranks formed on South Field, at the opposite end of the central plaza which Low dominates. It was generally agreed that the protesters should ignore (the wall that was forming in front of them. As one striker said, ""The jocks will probably get bored in half an hour and go away."" A crowd of onlookers was milling around under the windows. Tempers flared against the faculty for their refusal to do or say anything against the line of defiant students. ""It's a circus, a circus of fools,"" one man commented, pointing to the ranks of both the coalition and the faculty. For a while, Kirk's office rocked to a medley of protest songs and chants. Waving victory ""V's"" with their fingers to the crowd outside, the protesters chanted ad-lib verses of ""We Shall Overcome."" When the food strike broke, the Low protesters were only mildly surprised. At one point, wherr~a faculty spokesman was bargaining with the Majority Coalition for ""more time"" before the counterprotesters moved in to grab food from the envoys, a few of the people in Low dragged a .plastic bag full of garbage out of the kitchen to lower through the window in an expression of general disgust with the whole affair. They decided not to lower it. When the faculty made the announcement that ""no passage of material for the second floor"" was to be allowed, there was no great uproar inside Low. Most were too disgusted with the faculty to care. Eventually, over 700 amnesty supporters gathered at the sundial in a candlelight display of support for the demonstrators. By 8:30 the scene inside Low was one of relative calm. The door barricade in the far room had been removed and four or five protesters were attempting to secure the windows instead. After a brief debate, they decided not to destroy any furniture. People sat around, tired and waiting for a hot-plate supper. One group took out a game and began to play. Couples in the corners embraced and in Kirk's office, a circle formed around a fellow strumming a guitar. Leaving the besieged suite was harder than getting in. The blinds had been pulled down and the draperies drawn. None of the protesters v noticed when I lifted the drapes of* Mrs. King's office and slid onto the ledge. For a second, no one outside noticed either. Then the Coalition line began to shout and faculty members flocked toward me, assuring, ""There will be no punishment if you come down at this point."" I climbed down with their help, smiled politely when they said they would not take away my Columbia ID, and left. Two Coalition members shouted for their cameraman to get a picture of the ""deserter."" They missed."

A volatile crowd around Low Memorial Library swelled to over 2,500 last night when police turned back a group of 6 clergymen trying to enter the building with food. Emotions reached a high point when a student bolted from the crowd, fan through police, student and faculty lines, and scrambled into the building. The clergymen said they would try to enter the building again. Columbia president Grayson L. Kirk issued a statement shortly after 8 last night stating the university would make announcements each morning at 6 over the campus radio station as to when classes will be resumed. Neither the administration nor the strikers made any notable steps toward conciliation yesterday. The faculty ad hoc committee issued a resolution early yesterday proposing uniform punishment for all the strikers. Tb.e entire faculty passed a resolution Sunday condemning ""the occupation of normal university activities."" Protesters went to the air today to break a siege by the anti-strike Majority Coalition which has attempted to starve demonstrators out of Low Memorial Library. Students backing the strike at 4 p.m. began hurling canned food, fruit, bread and other staples to those manning Mr. Kirk's second floor offices. A police line was added at 6:30 p.m. to the faculty and coalition lines stationed around the library, when violence threatened to erupt between the coalition members and the food hurlers. Coalition members had attempted to bat down the food when the ""air strike"" started. When some coalition members jumped outside the hedge behind which they were formed and started shoving some of the hurlers, police decided to move their forces around Low. The punching and kicking scuffle broke out between about 200 ""jocks"" opposing the sit-in and about 80 Negro and white students who chanted ""Black Power"" and ""Food Power"" as they hurled the food. A tense crowd continued to mill around Low as darkness set in. The students inside Low stopped the flow of food themselves when they nailed the windows shut at 8 p.m. The windpws have been covered with blankets by the protesters in an apparent attempt to try to stop tear gas."

Despite Monday night's statement by protest leader Mark Rudd that the protesters were willing to compromise, Columbia president Grayson L. Kirk chose repression. 1,000 police stormed the campus, 90 students were injured and 628 arrested. But the tragedy of Columbia had just begun. The 2,000-plus ""jock coalition has now melted away. Reports indicate that the student body is now supporting the protest in overwhelming numbers. The student council has called for a general strike, supported by the ad hoc faculty steering committee. Delegations from CCNY and Long Island University have joined the demonstration. Grayson Kirk has lost control of his university. What was once a great university is now a battlefield. The collapse of Columbia is the result of an administration which ruled without vision,, of decisions made by men in authority who refused to bend to legitimate student demands. The goals the protesters seek are goals which are based on a philosophy grounded in the democratic process. It is a philosophy which places its confidence in the individual and which holds that the citizens of any community should be the ones who establish the rules which govern that community. At Columbia ; and at every university, the citizens of the community are the students and faculty. Kirk's refusal to accept that philosophy has cost his university dearly. With students and faculty in open revolt, the Columbia of two weeks ago is no more. The cost has been too high for the Columbia community to tolerate a return to non-representation. If Columbia is to survive, her administration must see that it can no longer rule with impunity."

Three weeks ago, they said it could never happen at Columbia. They were wrong once. Could they be wrong about Princeton, too? A comparative analysis of recent events at the two universities provides a number of telling differences _æ and similarities. The immediate issues behind the Columbia uprising are somewhat similar to those raised at Princeton fs the past several months. In fact, nothing could be more familiar to Princeton ears than cries of racism and collaboration with the military. IDA issue The Columbia insurrection began with an anti-IDA protest, much like that carried on by the Princeton SDS last fall. It took quite a different turn. At Princeton, 70 students staged a sit-in before the administration fully reviewed its alliance with the defense research organization. At Columbia, an entire campus has approached civil war in order to force such a review. The issues of racism are more subtle. Both schools have grappled with the problem unsuccessfully. Adjacent to black Harlem, Columbia has a history of poor community relations. The dispute over the gymnasium is but the latest manifestation of the university's alleged lack of concern for the ghetto. At Princeton, awareness of racial issues is just beginning, due to a potent and vociferous ABC. A recent manifestation of this awareness is the protest against university investments in South Africa. Deeper issues The average protester or antiprotester on the Columbia campus will cite IDA and the gym as the primary issues. There are deeper ones. Faculty and students at Columbia insist that negligence on the part of both faculty and administration has done much to incite and nourish the revolt. A weary chemistry professor, after a three-day vigil and a physical confrontation with city police, noted, ""What really is at stake is the whole problem of student power."" The dilemma of legitimacy of student protest was raised at Princeton over the IDA. Then, the university allowed outside legal action, but withheld its own discipline. At Columbia, police action was avoided until early yesterday morning. The architecture of the trustee-administration-faculty-student pyramid at Columbia is being reassessed following events this week. Like Princeton, the trustees at Columbia have been among the most difficult to convince of protesters' arguments. Less intransigent has been the administration, which now realizes the weight of ""aloofness"" charges; but it is still reluctant to change its attitude. The lack of consultation with faculty and students has been crucial in both allowing and perpetuating the crisis. One statistics professor claimed that the Columbia faculty bears as much blame as the administration. She decried the absence of community spirit among the faculty, and attributed it to the lack of community living. While Princeton faculty live, for the most part, near the campus, the Columbia faculty live throughout the New York area. The absence of ""togetherness,"" she said, breeds dissension and prevents the faculty from becoming a mediating force between students and administration. Another difference in faculty operation lies in the status of junior faculty members. Princeton, like most American universities, grants full voting privileges to all faculty members. Columbia denies non-tenured members _æ who frequently are in best contact < with students _æ the right to vote. Due to lack of space, they were not even seated in Sunday morning's ""all-faculty"" summit conference. And what of the students? Are they any different from those at Princeton? The SDS and its sympathizers number proportionately greater at Columbia. But amidst the enormous chaos, tension and anger on the Columbia campus, it is easy to forget that only 650 students of the university community's 25,000-plus were holding buildings. Princeton attitudes The great majority of students and faculty questioned said that a comparable proportion of dissenters at Princeton would be both difficult to muster and easy to overcomes They referred to general political attitudes at Princeton. A Columbia law student asserted that there is ""a built-in cynicism"" at Columbia, an eagerness to reform. Instrumental in creating the cynical and radical spirit in the surrounding metropolis. New York's diversity of viewpoints makes for an influx of new and better ideas, according to most students there. The lack of community spirit applies to students as well as to faculty. Off-campus social opportunities, great polarity between athletes and intellectuals and the large number of students are responsible for, this. Several student crusaders were quick to point out some of the striking similarities between Princeton and Columbia. Lack of moderates Both, for example, lack a signify. cant organization of Liberals who are not ""leftists."" The SDS has*"" dominated all reform movements, leaving no avenue for more moderate group identification. A professor of art history emphasized that the spirit at Columbia is not unique. Most fundamental, he claimed, is that ""this is the time of year when students used to make panty-raids."" Spring fever, he asserted, coupled with political unrest, creates a potential for disaster."

It was my judgment and that of my associates that this action be taken."" The words were those of haggard Columbia president Grayson L. Kii'k, speaking at a 6:15 a.m. press conference yesterday in the echoing rotunda of Low Memorial Library. The president, standing tall and portly in a gray three-piece business suit, appeared calm throughout the 35-minute session. On his left as he spoke was the vice-president and provost of the college, David B. Truman. Mr. Kirk read a 300-word prepared statement before accepting questions from 50 reporters. It said in part: ""If Columbia had been prepared to accede to the students' demand for amnesty from all disciplinary action resulting from their illegal conduct, we would have dealt a near-fatal blow not only to this institution but to the whole of American higher education. Columbia's action tonight thus is not merely in the interests of its own future but that of its sister institutions."" The president's second questioner asked whether he was resigning. ""I have not considered it,"" Mr. Kirk answered quietly. Mr. Truman denied that a great many faculty members would carry out their threats to leave Columbia's staff if police were called in. ""We had to work with them,"" Mr. Truman said. ""We obviously had to cooperate with them in laying out a general plan so the removal of the students would be as smooth as possible."" Early planning Mr. Kirk also affirmed that the logistics purposes, it was necessary to make plans with the police early in the evening."" He added that the plans could have been stopped at any point throughout the evening. Asked if he would be able to administer the university after the events of the night before, Mr. Kirk said, ""I believe we will."" Mr. Kirk also affirmed that the university would be pressing trespassing charges against the more than 600 arrested students. Neither Mr. Truman nor Mr. Kirk would specify the amount of academic punishment awaiting the arrested students. Mr. Kirk said that Mayor Lindsay had called him about midnight Monday for consultation on the situation. He denied that the mayor had attempted to bargain for a halt in Mr. Kirk's plans to bring in the police. Concerning charges of police brutality Mr. Truman said, ""Reports that I have show there were no serious injuries inside the building."" He praised the police for minimizing violence and carrying out the operation effectively. At 6:50 a.m. yesterday Mr. Kirk cut the conference short, saying that he and Mr. Truman had not lept all night and were tired. Newsmen were generally annoyed at his departure. Even as he left the rotunda to temporary offices on the ground level floor, students were gathering outside, chanting ""Kirk must go."""

The university announced that classes would not be held today, although the university will be open. It recommends that the faculty and students use the time to meet together for discussions. Over 3,500 Columbia students, faculty and employees signed a statement yesterday calling for the resignation of President Grayson L. Kirk, Vice-President David B. Truman, and the university trustees, who approved the order to send police on to the campus early yesterday morning. The move came in the wake of yesterday morning's arrest of 628 students in the five buildings which had been seized by the protesters early last week. The campus was under virtual police rule following the 1:30 a.m. decision by Mr. Kirk to clear the buildings. Sentiment concerning the president, who called in the police after six days of threats, was uniformly negative. Students chanted ""Kirk must go!"" throughout the day. A tighter hold was placed yesterday around the already closely guarded campus when faculty forbade access for a time to students. The only people admitted were faculty and staff members. Irate Columbia students thronged outside the main gate, demanding admittance. By yesterday afternoon, students living in dorms on the campus were being allowed in. The mood of the campus was one of subdued disbelief today. The two hours in the middle of the night during which the police struck took on a nightmarish aura. For many, it was too awful to believe. Mr. Kirk made the move at a time when many of the protesting students felt their demand for amnesty as a prerequisite for bargaining was very close to being realized. The police did not surprise the campus, however, when they moved in at 2:25 a.m. Rumors had been spreading around the campus since 12:30 that a ""bust"" was coming. Students of the anti-strike Majority Coalition who were blockading the pi .testers in Low Memorial Library moved off en masse at 1:45 a.m. They had said previously they would leave if the police came to remove the students. By 2:30, 30 police were lined up by twos where 70 students and faculty were lying six deep in an attempt to save the protesters from the police. Several hundred onlookers were gathered around to watch. Plainclothes policemen were guarding one side of the door. At about 2:35, a Spanish instructor named Fredrick Courtney became the first casualty of the night, Mr. Courtney had been with the group blocking the door. He left for an unknown reason. When he tried to return, three burly plainclothesmen tackled him and they came crashing into a group of onlookers.  When the instructor attempted to wriggle free, the police pummeled him into the ground, apparently kneed him, then dragged him over to a hedge beyond which people were being allowed to stay, and threw him over the hedge. His injuries were mainly bruises. While this was going on around Low, Hamilton Hall, the building filled entirely by blacks, was falling victim to an inside job by the Tactical Police Force. The TPF entered the building via an underground series of tunnels. The Hamilton protesters offered no resistance, and were led peacefully to paddywagons parked by the steps of the library. The first building to be seized a week ago, Hamilton was the first to be regained by the university. It was widely known that not all of the people in Hamilton were connected with Columbia. Shortly before the police raid, the Harlem community blacks left. Around 3 a.m. havoc broke loose nearly simultaneously in Low, Avery and Fayerweather halls. A police captain outside Low asked the singing barricaders to move several times. When he said, ""You don't want to be arrested. You're all college students,"" they screamed back, ""Yes we do."" With that, the captain ordered his men ahead. The police simply plowed into the screaming barricaders, pushing, shoving and hurling them out of the way. No arrests were made. Here, as in other places throughout the two hours of turmoil, the plainclothesmen were the most blatantly physical of the police. At the same time, human barricades in front of Avery and Fayerweather were forcibly dispersed. ""This man, this river of police, came storming towards us,"" claimed one Barnard girl who had been outside Fayerweather and was injured in the scuffle. By 3:05 the police were inside Low, had begun to evacuate Avery and Fayerweather, and had already regained Hamilton. Mathematics, reportedly housing the most violent extremists, was not broken into until 3:45, and it was 5:00 before the last protesters were brought out. The more squirming an arrested protester did while he was carried out, the harder was his landing outside. A police spokesman said yesterday that none of the entering policemen carried nightsticks. When he was told that St. Luke's and Knickerbocker Hospitals had treated 96 persons, he expressed surprise, claiming that police had not harmed anyone willfully. One student who was being carried out of Mathematics wrapped in a blanket' by six policemen, was apparently giving them trouble. When they slammed him to the ground to get a better grip on the blanket, he yelled, ""I'll walk out! I'll walk out!"" One of the police said back, ""Oh no you won't!"" The student's last ""I'll walk out!"" was cut short by the dull thud of the striking nightstick. The scene resembled a war zone far more than it did a college campus. Shouts and screams could be heard across the campus for the entire two hours. Columbia basketball coach Jack Rohan was standing outside Mathematics about 4 a.m. with a look of disbelief watching the students being hauled away. He had been representing the administration in a last-ditch attempt to convince the protesters to come out before the cops came in. ""It couldn't have been resolved without this action,"" he said sadly. When asked, he replied that Columbia had ""definitely"" lost basketball prospects due to the adverse publicity. Sidney* Davidoff, troubleshooter for New York's Mayor John V. Lindsay, was also standing outside of the math building. Asked when the university had requested the police to move in, he gave a straight-faced ""about seven days ago."" Most of the buildings the strikers occupied were in shambles when' seen yesterday morning. A dispute arose as to how much damage the university was responsible for, and how much the students. Most of the damage can be traced to the students, with some major exceptions. Police broke through the glass panels on every door in Mathematics, for instance, to root out the strikers. For many of the rooms, the police's entrance was the first time those rooms had been touched. The police moved forcefully and methodically as they handled the protesters outside the halls. Police herded the groups gathered around Avery and Fayerweather Halls into the plaza in front of Low Library, after they had isolated the areas around the halls. It was virtually impossible to move from one area to another about the campus. One Columbia student raised his arms in defense or resistance, and was beaten to the ground by three policemen. They shoved him down three flights of narrow stairs. Mounted police rode up and down Broadway ""like Cossacks,"" said one student who was practically trampled by a galloping cop."
http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1968/4/27/columbia-demonstration-enters-4th-day-pnew/?page=single,Harvard Crimson,N/A,N/A,4/27/68,Columbia Demonstration Enters 4th Day,James K. Glassman,,1124,"NEW YORK, April 26--An estimated 300 Columbia University students, entrenched for the fourth day in five classroom and administration buildings, won support today from the neighboring Harlem community and from black militants H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael. Brown, his face drawn and nearly milky pale, and Carmichael, in a blue pin-striped suit, led a crowd of 200 junior high and high school youths on a charge from Amsterdam Avenue, through police lines, and onto the besieged campus. Police immediately sent for reinforcements and sealed off the campus, allowing only Barnard and Columbia students to enter through the outside gates. Other police guarded entrances 10 classroom buildings. Over 100 policemen were stationed around the area, and in nearby Harlem extra patrols roamed the streets. On to Hamilton Hall The group marched to Hamilton Hall, which has been held by 50 black students and an unknown number of community militants for the past three days. Brown later delivered a speech on the steps of the building as admirers cheered him on. He said that he backed the demands of the demonstrators and threatened violence from the community if the demands are not met. ""We are going to let Columbia know that if they don't deal with the black brothers here, they're going to have to deal with the black people of Harlem,"" Brown said. Mark Rudd, chairman of Columbia's chapter of Students for a Democratic Society, said at a press conference at 7:30 p.m. tonight that he would not settle for anything less than a complete amnesty for all participants in the demonstration. He also rejected a proposal for a tripartite commission of students, faculty, and administration to help resolve the conflict. The demand for amnesty has now become the focus of the demonstration. One of the other three demands--stopping construction on a gymnasium in Morningside Park--has been met at least in part. The other two--ending ties with the Institute for Defense Analyses and dropping punishments for an earlier demonstration--are less important and are close to resolution now. Vow to Stay The 300 students inside the five buildings--Hamilton, Low Library, Avery Hall, Fayerweather Hall, and the mathematics building--again vowed to stay inside until their demands are met. Although no official statement has yet been made on the progress of negotiations between the students and the administration, several reliable sources here indicate that Columbia offered to let all the demonstrators off with mere warnings. The students, however, insist on no punishment at all. The Columbia Spectator, the university's daily newspaper, reported yesterday that sources indicated that the work stoppage on the gymnasium, announced yesterday as ""temporary,"" will be permanent. Today was the first day that members of the community bordering on Columbia actively participated in the demonstration. In all, 400 teenage Negro youths assembled on the grassy quadrangle in the center of the Columbia campus. They chanted anti-war slogans, listened to the radio, and cheered on speakers. The $10-million Columbia gymnasium was planned for an area that many of these youths use as a playground. Brown emphasized that this fight was the community's too. He and Carmichael left after about an hour. They were scheduled to speak in Newark tonight. Two Factions The campus is severely split into two factions--those who are sympathetic with the demands of the demonstrators and those who want them expelled. The sympathetic faculty group, called the Ad Hoc Committee, vociferously booed Vice President David B. Truman last night when he announced that Columbia was ordering outside police onto the campus. Several distinguished faculty members associated with this group have threatened to resign unless the demands are met. The other faculty group, led by Warner Shilling, a government professor, has said that it will make no concessions to the demonstrators. One faculty member reported that Shilling said at a meeting last night, ""Either Rudd goes or I go."" Shilling is faculty leader of a group of several hundred conservative students, many of them campus athletes, who call themselves the Majority Coalition. A leader of the Coalition, Frank Dann, a member of the swimming team, claimed that the administration had promised him that SDS demonstration leaders would be expelled. Dann's group continually harassed the demonstrators today, but there were no incidents of violence this time. Last year conservative students and SDS members came to blows during a demonstration against Marine recruiters. Beat Twenty Dollars Still, tempers were high. One student complained that while the University was closed he was missing classes. ""That costs me twenty dollars a day,"" he said. ""And I'm going to beat that twenty dollars out of one of those SDS kids when I get my hands on him."" Last night, members of the Coalition came to the steps of Fayeweather and demanded a chance to ""get even"" with the demonstrators inside. ""Three years of the administration giving in to SDS is a long time to restrain ourselves,"" one said. Low Library, the huge Roman-style building where Columbia President Grayson Kirk has his offices, remained the focus of attention today. Professor Robert Fogelson announced that students would no longer have free access to the building. He explained that if the demonstrators left the building they would have their identification cards confiscated and would be unable to re-enter. Food and messages could be brought inside however. The first to leave was Gary Menaged, who said that his father had wanted to talk to him about the demonstration. Menaged, who had been inside the library for two days, said that he did not know he could not return. A student saw Menaged as he climbed down from one of the library windows and brought him over to a proctor, who took his identification card. Menaged, who appeared pale and tired, said that the demonstrators had adequate food. Girls had set up a kitchen, he said. He also said that the people inside feared a police charge last night. They had the doors and windows barricaded with filing cabinets, chairs, and tables. ""Everyone inside was really scared,"" he said. But the police did not get inside the building. Instead, they charged the faculty members who had surrounded Low on the outside to keep away assaults of conservative students. Twenty-five plainclothes police, billy clubs concealed at first under their trench coats, tried to break up the faculty for some unknown reason. In the melee that followed, one faculty member, Richard Greenman suffered a five-inch gash on the forehead and had to be hospitalized. An unidentified woman was also slightly injured. According to the New York Post, sources in Mayor John V. Lindsay's office said that the police moved toward the building at the request of Kirk, although Kirk did not intend the men to break up the faculty, but merely ""get into position."
http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1968/4/27/sds-and-friends-pbtbhere-is-a/,Harvard Crimson,N/A,N/A,4/27/68,SDS and Friends,John G. Short,,815,"THERE is a large number of serious, discontented, left-leaning people on this campus who, while they stay out of the statement-making and infighting of daily political affairs, muster their personal commitment in the clutch to go so far as to do something illegal for the cause. Someone in SDS once called them their ""shock troops."" These are the people who make or break a Dow demonstration at Harvard. It was their numbers that blockaded Dow recruiter Fred Leavitt last October three days after Federal troops had driven them off the steps of the Pentagon. This seeming strength of their organization then led some SDS leaders, in their more extravagant moments, to threaten closing down the University. But it is this pivotal group--let's call them the liberal activists--which has recently turned away from SDS, and which probably really didn't believe in them anyway. What is most important is that the liberal activists never really know what SDS is doing or how they decide on policies. They find out what they know through the media--from the Crimson on Harvard events, and from the national press about far-off places like Wisconsin and B.U. The press, of course, hands its readers what it wants, and most of that is sensational. It was sensational news about police brutality in Oakland and Washington that turned the liberal activists against Dow in the fall, and it is the overplayed copy about SDS' demanding no tuition that disenchants them now. SDS has a fairly small nucleus of members who regularly go to meetings and work on committees. One of their leaders estimated this group numbered from 50 to 60. That may be a high estimate. As with every activity at Harvard, the active members form something of a club. They room together, hold bull sessions together, and eat in Lehman Hall together--not exclusively, but usually. If SDS people don't mix much with the liberal activists and get their message out that way, it is because the two are motivated by almost completely different goals. The SDS activists have made social concerns their lives. But their liberal ""shock troops"" have not: these students perceive their own estrangement from the government as temporary and without real significance to their private lives. FROM what their sources of information have told them, the liberal activists see SDS's recent actions as embarrassingly inept. First they thought SDS claims that Harvard's tuition was being used to preserve class structure within the University were paranoid and irrational. Second, the media told them that SDS was sabotaging Eugene McCarthy (the liberal activist candidate) in Wisconsin. Third, they saw the SDS demonstration that cost Boston University $500,000 in ""bad"" money us a misdirected, simply sensational protest which was neither practical nor sincere. If SDS really cared about slumlords, they asked, why did they wait until then to oppose them? And finally, the liberal activists saw SDS in confusion after the death of Martin Luther King. A Boston rally held by SDS and other radical groups seemed purposeless and poorly timed. Above all, it was nearly all white. An SDS demand to pull all police out of the ghetto was severely criticized in the Crimson by Dr. Robert Coles, who asserted that the white radicals lacked any understanding of what was happening there. And meanwhile Afro came on strong and took nearly all the newsmaking campus activism away from them. GIVEN that the liberal activists are this disaffected and that they do form most of SDS's strength, then the radical takeover of administration buildings at B.U. and Columbia couldn't be repeated at Harvard now. The basic reason why Columbia and B.U. won't happen at Harvard is because students here don't think that the University is important enough. They don't feel that the University has enough impact on people like themselves to make it a channel for social change. Harvard students have been so persuaded of their own intelligence that they are not awed by professors, or by almost any thing about the University. This attitude, I think, is quite different from that of almost every other university. In other words, if a radical at B.U. thinks that the university is important enough to change, he thinks so because he sees the university as molding the minds of his fellow students. He thus sees it as a social determinant. Harvard students have been taught to think more of themselves, and are not likely to believe that the university could be nearly as important as they are as individuals. The liberal activists thus hate to be organized by anyone, and especially by people who don't have their confidence, like SDS. That's why they don't get involved in the dirty work of daily radicalism as represented by SDS's current 'Ten Days in April"" organizing campaign. And because the dramatic preconditions of October were absent last February, the liberal activists weren't even there when Dow came back."

Glassman,,316,"The senior faculty of Columbia University voted 466-40 against a general amnesty for student demonstrators yesterday and called for the protestors to turn over the five campus buildings they have held since Tuesday. But the students, now estimated by the school to number between 500 and 600, refuse to budge until their demand for no punishment is met. Meanwhile, conservative students, members of the Majority Coalition, moved to ""starve out"" demonstrators in Low Library by encircling the building to prevent food from being brought inside. An agreement made with the faculty Friday stipulated that food was permitted. One student bearing food broke through the conservatives after a scuffle, but was reportedly stopped by faculty members, who also ring the building which houses President Grayson Kirk's offices. Columbia's board of trustees met Saturday and also rejected the demand for amnesty but placed all decisions on the matter in the hands of Kirk. There is widespread speculation at Columbia that New York City police will soon be called in to clear the demonstrators out of the buildings. The students, however, are securely barricaded in their classroom-fortresses. All entrances have been locked and blocked off with furniture and filing cabinets. As early as Friday, faculty and administration members expressed the fear that police would have to do a great deal of damage in order to get the demonstrators out of the buildings. Immanuel Wallerstein, a professor of sociology, said that if police were called onto the campus, the University would be ""burned down."" Another fear is that members of the neighboring Harlem community, generally sympathetic with the demonstrators, will pour onto the campus if police use force against the students. The two main entrances to the campus do not have gates, but large numbers of police have been on guard since Friday. The entire campus remains sealed off by police, with only Columbia and Barnard students allowed to enter."
http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1968/4/29/columbias-protest-pbtbhe-student-insurrection-at/,Harvard Crimson,N/A,N/A,4/29/68,Columbia's Protest,None listed,,406,"THE student insurrection at Columbia this past week cannot be labelled a simple exercise in hoodlumism. The demonstrators succeeded in raising (and perhaps resolving) a major issue of University-community relations, and it is not at all clear that any amount of the peaceful placard carrying which critics of the protest advocate would have had this effect. Columbia has a history of tactless expansionism and insularity in its dealings with the Morningside Heights community which surrounds it. A majority of the Faculty have voted that the immediate target of the protestors' anger, a gym under construction in Morningside Park, should not be built--at least until community leaders are given a chance to confer on an alternate site. The temporary halt in construction may well become permanent. To this triumph, the demonstrators can add the wider victory of invigorating conventional channels of reform. Events like those of last week only slightly threaten the fabric of society--they serve chiefly to alert University administrators to the danger of a self-interested community policy or of a cool disregard of intense student feeling on the way the University is run. While the accomplishments of the Columbia protest might not have been possible without the conspicuous seizure of an administration building, the demonstration gradually has disintegrated into a piece of civil disobedience in bad faith. When the protestors refused at first to talk with the Columbia Administration's spokesman David B. Truman, they opened themselves to charges of ""protest for protest's sake."" Since illegal demonstrations are intentionally public acts, how they look is not inconsequential. Tiny acts of vandalism by a few of the demonstrators were blown to huge proportions by the daily press. So the demonstrators must blame themselves for providing the public with an excuse to ignore the substance of the protest. NOW the protestors are intranisgently holding out for a promise of complete amnesty. While the small group which occupies five buildings at first spoke for the conscience of the majority of the Columbia community, now they are a minority, blocking the majority from going about its business as they lobby for their own interests. Having taken the brave plunge into civil disobedience, the demonstrators should not be dissipating the force of their action by refusing to face the possibility of some form of punishment. Having secured their primary goal--the demonstrators should abandon their battle posts and swallow their anarchic threats to burn down the University to save their own skins."
http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1968/4/30/kirk-agrees-to-form-special-committee/?page=single,Harvard Crimson,N/A,N/A,4/30/68,Kirk Agrees to Form Special Committee In Columbia Dispute,James K. Glassman,,905,"Columbia President Grayson Kirk last night agreed to set up a tripartite commission of students, faculty, and administration to settle the week-long sit-in at the university. Kirk submitted to the request of a 200-member ad hoc faculty committee, generally sympathetic with the student demonstrators, and also agreed to let faculty choose the student members of the commission. Mark Rudd, chairman of Columbia's Students for a Democratic Society, speaking for the 500 to 600 rebels, has already said he will not accept a tripartite commission. Before students leave the five buildings they now hold, they must be guaranteed amnesty, Rudd said. Earlier yesterday, a group of 80 Negro and white students, sympathetic with the student rebels, nearly broke through a blockade around Low Library in an effort to bring food to students entrenched in Kirk's offices inside. Yelling ""black power"" and ""food power,"" the sympathizers rushed 200 members of the anti-sit-in ""majority coalition,"" who stationed themselves around the large colonaded library Sunday night in an attempt to starve out the demonstrators. Fistfights broke out, but no one was injured. The sympathizers, who failed to breech the line, then began throwing food up to demonstrators standing on a ledge outside the second-floor library windows. Sources at Columbia say they are certain that classes will be cancelled today, although no official announcement was to have been made until 6 a.m. this morning. Demonstrators interpret cancellation as a sign the university is not yet willing to call in police to remove them from the buildings. Seize Hall Meanwhile, 300 non-demonstrating students seized a sixth building, Uris Hall, saying they wanted to keep it out of the hands of rebels who might want to shut it down. The ad hoc committee, which recommended the tripartite commission, called its plan ""the last possibility of a peaceful settlement."" The committee had said that if Kirk did not accept the plan, and if police are brought in, some of its members would physically oppose the police. Others threatened to resign. The 200 committee members represent all teaching ranks--from instructor through full professor. On Sunday, a meeting of all tenured Columbia professors approved their request for the commission. Also approved at that meeting was a resolution that apparently assures no demonstrators will be expelled. The resolution asks for uniform punishment for all the students. ""How could you expel several hundred students?"" said Seymour Melman, professor of Industrial Engineering. The demonstrators Sunday told the ad hoc committee to ""stop trying to perform a mediating function . . . and take a political position"" in favor of the demands including the general amnesty. If the student rebels still refuse to leave the buildings after the latest Kirk announcement, they will lose the support of the ad hoc committee, and probably the support of large numbers of more moderate sympathizers as well. The ad hoc committee said Sunday that it would completely withdraw from the dispute if the university accepts its plan and the demonstrators still refuse to leave. Faculty Buffer The members of the committee have served as a buffer between the students and the administration. On Thursday night, several of them who were trying to protect students inside the buildings, were attacked by plainclothesmen from the New York police department. The attack was termed ""a mistake"" by the university. With New York Mayor John V. Lindsay, the committee is also credited with persuading Kirk not to call in police earlier to remove the demonstrators as he had planned late last week. Kirk also said tonight that he would yield to a request to discuss the Morningside Park gymnasium issue with the mayor. The mayor is said to favor an alternate site for the gym, which was scheduled to be built on a site leased to Columbia in 1961 for only $3000 a year. Construction has already been halted temporarily at the mayor's request. The demonstrators now appear to have won clear victory on the primary objective of their demonstration--ending the gym construction. The gym was first seen as a magnanimous gesture when it was proposed in the late 1950's. Two gyms were planned--a $10 million one for the university and a $1.6 million one for residents of the neighboring Morningside Heights and West Harlem community. Columbia agreed to pay for the construction of the community gym and cover the maintenance cost of $75,000 a year. The gym would include a regulation-size basketball court, lockers, showers, weight rooms, and a 75-foot-by-20-foot swimming pool. Community opposition to the gym has developed only recently. Many Harlem leaders argued that they were not consulted on the plans. They also complained that the gyms are a ""Jim Crow"" set-up, with separate entrances for the predominantly black people of the community and the predominantly white students. They also say that Columbia is trying to ""buy off"" the city with its gymnasium plan. They argue that no private corporation has the right to take over park land. For community leaders and protesting students, the gym has become the symbol of what they see as a land-gobbling university. Columbia has acquired over 100 buildings in recent years in the area of the campus. The University has evicted tenants and torn down buildings to make way for Columbia classrooms and dormitories. Recently, Columbia sought housing for faculty members in suburban Orange-town, New York. As an explanation for this, columnist Jimmy Breslin reported that Kirk said, ""Well, you know, we have a terrible crime problem around the school."
http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1968/5/1/bloodbath-pblbess-than-eight-hours-after/,Harvard Crimson,N/A,N/A,5/1/68,Bloodbath,None listed,,254,"LESS than eight hours after Columbia President Grayson Kirk agreed to set up a tripartite commission of students, faculty, and administration to settle the university's sit-in, Kirk asked police to remove the rebels from the five buildings they occupied. The police removed them, according to eyewitness reporters, savagely and bloodily, injuring 100 badly enough to require medical attention. Perhaps Kirk did not expect such a gory display, and it is assumed he is not happy about it. But he should have realized that a middle-of-the-night invasion by police who tend to react quickly to student resistance could easily explode. David B. Truman, university vice-president, had conceded that the buildings could not be retaken ""without some roughing up."" Kirk and Truman's miscalculation has so discredited the administration on the campus that by 11 p.m. last night, 8500 students had signed a petition asking for Kirk's ouster. Even if the administration had eventually found it necessary to use police, Kirk acted unwisely by calling for the storming without waiting for a response to his peace-making effort. But if Kirk, or Truman, or anyone high in the Columbia administration had had the respect of the students, he could have personally spoken to the demonstrators--much as Dean Glimp spoke to protestors at Mallinckrodt last October--and perhaps achieved a bloodless settlement. The sad fact, however, is that the president of Columbia cannot communicate with his students at all, and was reduced to a surprise show of force. The bloodstains are testimony to Kirk's failure to function as a president."

Taubman,,469,"The current student demonstration to prevent the construction of a gymnasium at Columbia University is simply another in a recent wave of campus demonstrations which represent an accretion of student power. The demonstrations (and the one at Columbia is typical) usually follow a pattern. Members of a school_æ_s Students for a Democratic Society and-or Afro-American Society _æ_take over_æ the administration building and refuse to move until their demands are met. Embarassed by the students_æ_ presence and anxious to get on with their day-to-day activities, the administrators yield to at least a portion of the students_æ_ demands. What is interesting about this is that virtually no cries of opposition from faculty, students, or administrators are heard regarding either the representativeness of the protesters or the legitimacy of their demands. The South Africa investments case at Cornell is a good example. When the University announced the establishment of a study group which was to include two students, no one protested the manner in which these students were selected. One student was chosen by SDS (which did not even represent all the demonstrators), and the other was selected by a student government which was elected on the basis of a pledge to abolish itself, and which did not really represent students, either. Yet no one complained. And when students at most universities (Cornell is an exception here) present their demands to the administration, the administration places higher priority on _æ_recapturing_æ the administration building than on rationally considering the merits of the students_æ_ demands. Why have students been able to demonstrate such extensive power during the academic year? Surely, part of the answer can be found in the rise of the Left on most college campuses. Aided by continued opposition to the war in Vietnam and staffed by nonstudent draft resisters and antiwar students, the Movement has been able to perfect techniques of mass organization and persuasion. The Movement has also managed to capitalize on the growing awareness among middle class liberals of the disparities between their aspirations and ideals, on the one hands, and the sobering facts of reality, on the other. The rise in student power is also attributable to the sharp increase in the number of militant black students on many campuses during the past two years. Black militants can force the administration to respond to their demands since they know administrators will be reluctant to expel those of them who have been specially recruited. To be sure, the rise in student power is not unhealthy. Hopefully, it will alert faculty and administrators to be aware of student problems and stand ready to act on student demands before a destructive, and possibly violent, confrontation occur. At the same time, students outside SDS and AAS groups should be oved to act, seeking to utilize their student power in representative student organizations."

While anarchy is an evil to be avoided in all communities, this is especially true within the academic sphere. This community places a supreme value on rationality; displays of violence and irresponsible force serve the cause of those who wish to impose restriction on the great degree of intellectual freedom within this nation. The spectacle of students locking-in University officials, closing academic offices, and forcing a general halt in university business is sad and deplorable. However noble the cause for which the demonstrating students are taking action, the means which they have chosen to win that cause simply cannot be justified. The plight of many European and Latin American universities points up the danger of violent student action. Nothing is gained and everything is lost at such institutions when students take to the _æ_streets_æ to voice their grievances. Hopefully here at Cornell, students, faculty, and administrators realize the necessity for open channels and open dialogue on the problems which confront us. Because violence in pursuit of any goal is surely no virtue."

IN most cases the activists were a small fraction of the student body. At Columbia, for instance, only a few hundred of the 27,000 students were involved in the demonstrations. Many of the others were openly hostile to it. At Olympic Community College in Bremerton, Wash, a score of students invaded the president_æ_s office Wednesday vowing to stay until the disciplinary expulsion of the student body_æ_s president-elect was rescinded. The president-elect, Forrest Adkins, 26, was told to leave after being accused of shouting obscenities at the faculty director of student affairs. Some 550 students and 40 faculty members took over the administration building at Colgate University, Hamilton, N.Y., April 10 and held it for five days in a protest against alleged racial discrimination by fraternities. Colgate_æ_s enrollment is 1,690. The sit-in ended when the university revolked the charter of Phi Delta Theta, one of the main targets of the demonstration, and promised to review admission procedures of other fraternities."

But by yesterday the central issue had become whether the several hundred demonstrators should receive amnesty. IN between the change in issues there occurred a massive sit-in. The student-demonstrators achieved a major victory through their once-unorthodox tactics. They succeeded in halting temporarily the gym_æ_s construction at Morningside Park. But, unwilling to accept their victory, the demonstrators have pledged to sit in until they are granted disciplinary amnesty. Thus another significant issue is involved here. Columbia remains in the Stone Ages in its undergraduate disciplinary procedure. Disciplinary cases are adjudicated by the faculty without student participation. But the interplay of objectives only served to muddle several valid grievances. Now that the Lions have firmly entrenched themselves both on campus and on the front page of The New York Times, they_æ_re convinced they can blackmail the university into anything. Their tactics, meanwhile, illustrate their ends-justify-any-and-all-means theory. For the better part of a week, they_æ_ve shut down a major university. They have brought in outsiders who just love the idea of sitting in_æregardless of the cause. And they have reportedly pillaged much of their conquered territory_æeven to the point of smoking President Grayson Kirk_æ_s cigars (without a Strickman filter, no doubt). But the worst is yet to come. Although it didn_æ_t begin at Columbia, the idea of a lock-in or sit-in has been glamorized and has spread to other major campuses. Campus activists have become so convinced of their own self-righteousness that they_æ_ve taken it unto themselves to force their arguments down the throats of others. The danger of such violent demonstrations becomes stronger. As the demonstrators get carried away with their apparent success, they change the focus from the issue involved to the means employed. They also show that while they are willing to engage in civil disobedience, they_æ_re not willing to pay the expected price. Therefore, the demonstrators_æ_ objectives, while honorable, are tainted by their tactics. They may have won a temporary victory, but is such a victory really worth it?"

Later, the blockade runners were pushed back after tossing food to the sit-ins. A group of about 80 Negro and white students, sympathetic to their self-imprisoned fellow-demonstrators, chanted _æ_Black Power_æ and _æ_Food Power_æ before rushing a superior force of 200 blockaders opposed to the demonstrations. There were no reports of injuries in the brief punching and kicking match on the Low Memorial Library lawn outside Kirk_æ_s second floor office. It was the first clash of any magnitude between opposing groups of Columbia students during a week-long militant uprising that has disrupted the Ivy League campus. Sit-ins by 500 to 600 demonstrators protesting a university building expansion program have brought a halt to educational activities for most of Columbia_æ_s 27,500-member student body. The university classrooms were deserted again yesterday as the sit-ins refused to budge from five buildings they have occupied unless granted amnesty. Possibility of a break in the deadlock came when Kirk said he was willing to accept a student-faculty-administrative committee of 12 to act as a court of appeals for any punishment meted out to the demonstrators. Such a committee had been recommended by a faculty group. Meanwhile, a sixth building, Uris Hall, was seized by 300 nondemonstrating students, who said they wanted to keep it out of the hands of rebels who might shut it down. Over the weekend, about 200 nondemonstrating students launched their blockade of the Low Library in an effort to starve out 100 or so rebels in Kirk_æ_s office. Paul Vilardi, a pre-medical student and former football player, said his blockade group was in sympathy with the sit-in_æ_s aims but not with the tactics. The blockade thwarted initial efforts to replenish the food supplies of the sit-ins in Kirk_æ_s office. Also barred from entering was an unidentified woman who said she was a doctor and who tried to bring a shopping bag full of medical supplies into the library. The blockaders spent the night bivouacked on the lawn outside the library in rather chilly spring temperatures. The students also demanded an end to Columbia_æ_s participation in a defense-oriented government research project, which they linked with the war in Vietnam."

First of all, the students_æ_ demands are as follows: 1. General amnesty for protesters. 2. Cancellation of the Morningside Heights Gym project. 3. Severance of University ties with the Institute for Defense Analysis. 4. Amnesty for six students who sat in protest against IDA earlier this month. 5. A bipartite (faculty-student) judiciary system, and 6. An end to the ban on indoor demonstration at Columbia. The first three demands are considered inviolate; that is, the students will not end their siege unless these demands are met. The inference (not an explicit admission) is that the last three demands are at least negotiable. However, a group of faculty members in contact with the students has urged them to consider foregoing amnesty in favor of _æ_token punishment._æ The most significant aspect of the Columbia siege is that the issues under protest are clear-cut. The University leased the Morningside Heights site from the City for three thousand dollars a year (Jimmy Breslin in the New York Post intimates that an individual who might undertake a similar lease would be _æ_liable to receive five indictments_æ). There has been almost universal condemnation of the University for its Morningside Heights project in the past, and the University has chosen to ignore all such criticism. The demand for amnesty is really what holds up the works at this point. This is not a case of civil disobedience; the student at Columbia are in revolt against the University Administration, and there_æ_s difference. Civil disobedience is undertaken with the premise that in a democratic society, martyrdom will raise burning issues in a manner that will force the society to take note and to reconsider its stance vis a vis those issues. Under these circumstances, the civilly disobedient must fully expect punishment for his act. The students at Columbia contend that no such democracy exists within the confines of their university. There is no judicial system at Columbia to speak of, and the University, if it is to force the demonstrators out, must have them arrested for criminal trespass. Here it is important to note that the Columbia faculty has strongly urged against such arrests, and in fact has ringed the buildings in which the students sit to prevent arrests. Thus the question of ending the siege boils down to the administrators_æ_ recalcitrance versus the demonstrators_æ__æ_; and if the issues are as clear-cut as this writer believes, then who should give in? Where there is not possibility for the redress of the students_æ_ grievances _æ_ except through the means they present employ _æ_ why souldn_æ_t there be amnesty once the students_æ__æ_ other demands are met? The Sun editors admit to the justice and the merit of the students_æ_ cause _æ_ and as far as the means to attain the desire ends go, it is important to see that at this point, any undesirable consequences they entail fall directly on the University, and not upon the aggrieved community (Morningside Heights and West Harlem) in whose name and cause the demonstrators act. It is easy to see that the community cares more about Columbia_æ_s incursions and transgressions _æ_ in the form of Columbia_æ_s extensive role as slumlord and realty investor _æ_ than it does about Columbia_æ_s educational endeavors. And who is to say that the community is wrongly aggrieved? _æ_ Columbia University, whose educational endeavors come directly at the expense of the community? Certainly it is unfortunate that Columbia may be gravely harmed in the process (and this writer is not trying to be glib) but can the community be blamed for wanting to rid itself of an agent of its own degradation? But the Columbia siege is unique. To be sure, it is a radical_æ_s dream, and imitative ventures will no doubt ensue. But these ventures too will demand judgment on their individual merits. Perhaps the Columbia experience will leave other administrations forewarned, and perhaps the conditions that provoked the Columbia siege can be eradicated before the next siege is necessary. We_æ_ll see."

The former journal finds rationality succumbing to puns like _æ_Poison Ivy_æ (Friday, April 26), while the latter has difficulty deciding whether the Columbia protest signifies the end of the democratic processes in the United States. Both display a remarkable shallowness by the implications they are willing, but should not be able to draw. Their analogies, and hence their analyses, demonstrate a blatant disregard for the salient distinctions between the structure of a university and American society. IN the process, the key legitimating factor for a university protest and the major argument against a social protest is lost. For anyone to discuss how this protest is an invitation to general lawlessness and anarchy would be a great feat. Students must continue to work through channels, must respect law and order, and must, therefore, abandon their protest, would argue these analysts. But what is the correct procedure when the channels close? Can students elect a new university president? Can students grant power to their student government? Can students try their peers without being overruled (or for that matter, even consider cases at Columbia)? It would be a stern political observer who would say submission is the answer at all times. Or it could be Grayson Kirk. Democracy? There is little other than desire to study and fear of reprisal to discourage a student protest. But although these are formidable factors, they are in no way legitimating factors for administrative prerogative. Back in society, one can vote, one can try to get elected, on can engage in some protest because the government is rendered institutionally responsive to its citizens. While C. Wright Mills can point to certain hostile factors, the generally democratic nature of the whole system can be disputed only with great difficulty. At a university it is all quite simple: administrations are not really legitimate sources of power. Those who seek analogies could better look to labor-management relations as the corresponding relationship. But very few people there would be willing to tell a union that if the appropriate channels of communication broke down, a strike should e avoided because it would lead to anarchy. Labor and management are enemies, hence power, moderated by rationality, determines how settlements are reached. Administrators, as of late, have attempted to foster the bogus concept of a _æ_university community_æ upon student bodies in an attempt to pacify the malcontents. As proof, they point to token concessions, but everybody knows that when the pressures build, you-know-who takes over. Certainly students know that they cannot exercise the strength that unions can, nevertheless in the abstract sense, they have a similar source of power. Might and Right This is not to say that might makes right, but it is to say that might doesn_æ_t necessarily make wrong. Those who choose to castigate the Columbia student for introducing anarchy, should realize that anarchy is occasionally preferable to despotism. One question is whether the students_æ_ demands were correct. Most would say they were. The implication is that the administration was incorrect. Second is whether the students gained or lost by their means. This is still moot. They have disrupted classes (bad), but they have achieved most demands (good) and the relative weight of these actions should be focused upon. Finally, the question is whether they have any business asking for amnesties. They think they do because it is a power confrontation, and they should exert as much power as they can. To condemn them implies a misunderstanding of power confrontations: there is very little right or wrong except as defined by what society-at-large specifically permits or forbids. Until administrations accept a more meaningful student role in governing their organization, their power will remain largely unlegitimated in the eyes of student activists. Goals It is at the present stage, however, that this writer feels the demonstrators_æ_ position has little justification. They have received concessions on almost all their demands and yet continue to disrupt the university go gain amnesty. This end is wrong, as the goal should be trial for their action by peers, and not amnesty. But people have unfortunately tended to make an artificially black-and-white issue out of a grey one."

The campus, which was closed yesterday to all but university employees and dormitory residents, will open today for _æ_relevant discussion._æ No classes are scheduled. IN the club swinging, fist fighting, pushing and kneeing that marked the violent subjugation of the Columbia demonstrators, 100 youths and 15 policemen were reported injured, none seriously. There were 628 arrests on changes of trespass, the Associated Press reported. A group of elected student leaders called last night for continuation of a student strike until further notice and for the resignations of President Grayson Kirk and Vice President David B. Truman, in a broadcast over the Columbia student radio station WKCR. President Kirk, who called in the police to smash the demonstration, said he had no intention of resigning. The Columbia faculty issued a statement announcing that today would be set aside for relevant discussion,_æ that a tri-partite committee would be set up to discuss disciplinary matters, and that a steering committee of nine professors would work toward bringing the university back to normal, a member of the Columbia Spectator reported. New York Times reporter Bob Thomas said after the morning police action he had been severely beaten by police, and added: _æ_I observed some really savage beatings given to students._æ Rabbi A. Bruce Goldman was hospitalized in St. Lukes Hospital after being beaten, WKCR reported. About 3:05 a.m. yesterday police assembled in front of Hamilton Hall and said if the students occupying it came out peacefully there would be no arrests. When there was no response, they entered the building through tunnels which connect the buildings. They herded students out of Hamilton and Low Library without resistance, according to a WKCR spokesman. Police used force in clearing Fayerweather Hall and Avery Hall. _æ_Night sticks were used freely,_æ WKCR reported. Students were driven back to Ferris Booth Hall, two blocks away, and a number of students were beaten outside. Many students were in shock, the radio station reported."

Disciplinary power is vested entirely in the university president, which effectively means that one of his assistants hears and rules on all cases. There is no faculty or student participation I the Columbia disciplinary force. When many students felt they had exhausted all legitimate channels of redress, a massive lock-in ensued. While the propriety of students_æ_ tactics is questionable, two points remain clear. First, their grievance against the university judicial system is valid. Second, the tactics endanger the stability and the very existence of the university. We have been far more fortunate at Cornell. Students have objected to the adjudicatory system and the University has listened. Students argued for participation in their own system of punishments and the university agreed and formed the Undergraduate Judiciary Board. Last year, students argued that the UJB, while a major step in the proper direction, was basically a showy fa_ade. The UJB _æ_decided_æ; the faculty committee either accepted or overruled. The real power _æ_ and the only power _æ_ lay with the faculty. Thus, again the University listened. The Sindler Commission was formed last year partly to re-examine the Cornell judicial structure. Its report was finalized in September and dialogue has since taken place. Such channels are _æ_ unlike at Columbia _æ_ open here and students have been able to work with the rest of the academic community in achieve a viable, progressive, and a mutually-acceptable proposal. This proposal _æ_ a modified form of the structure originally outlined by the Sindler Commission _æ_ is one of the two plans that goes before the faculty this afternoon. Hopefully, it will be the plan that the faculty accepts. The modified Sindler proposal, as approved by the Faculty Committee on Student Affairs, calls for an all-student conduct board and a joint student-faculty appellate board. Except for suspension or expulsion, the latter would review cases only upon appeal by the defendant. The basic difference between the two proposals is the structure of the conduct board, the board with original jurisdiction. We feel that the Sindler proposal of an all-student board _æ_ rather than a joint student-faculty group _æ_ is far more justifiable. Those who oppose the Sindler proposal cite the _æ_community_æ nature of Cornell and how students should be judged by the _æ_community._æ What they fail to appreciate is that were we to accept the _æ_community_æ argument, neither students nor faculty would be judged by their peers. Faculty do not want to be disciplined by students and students do not want to be punished by faculty. Thus our _æ_community_æ is not quite that. Students, as do faculty, feel justified in demanding that they be tried by their peers. IN any case, the joint appellate group would safeguard against unfair verdicts by the conduct board. Moreover, the trend at Cornell _æ_ and in a much more rational and calm manner than at Columbia _æ_ is toward greater student involvement in student matters. The trend at Cornell _æ_ unlike at Columbia _æ_ has been progressive. A decision by the faculty this afternoon to enact the Sindler Proposals would demonstrate their respect for students and for the results of rational dialogue."

The civil rights movement of the early 1960_æ_s bogged down and was frustrated by the uncaring attitudes of White America. The United States became involved in a war in Vietnam which has touched the consciences of millions of people. Violence and civil disobedience have replaced docility and reason. Idealistic students have seen their ideals shattered by jarring reality. Blacks are angry; they fight against a repressive society by burning and destroying it. Hundreds of thousands of people have become alienated from the traditional processes of change. Students have learned from the civil rights and anti-war movements. Today_æ_s students are not the passive students of a decade ago. They see what is wrong in their society and in their universities. They will no longer question but accept; they will demand and fight. That is the meaning of demonstrations at Columbia now and at Berkeley before. University administrations which ignore student demands will be overrun; buildings will be seized. The whole concept of a university will be rethought and changed if necessary, violently if necessary. The Columbia demonstration was touched off by that University_æ_s decision to build a gymnasium where houses once stood. The University forced residents out-oftheir homes to build a recreational facility which these black people will be able to use if they literally enter through a back entrance. Other issues quickly flared. Columbia, like Pennsylvania, has accepted classified research projects from the Government. Students in New York demand that their University discontinue these projects or face seizure or worse. The Columbia University administration has been indifferent to student demands. They haven_æ_t cared enough for their students because their interests are different from student interests. An administration is an elite which often develops its own priorities. The situation at the University is similar to the one at Columbia. Administrators at Pennsylvania are too often indifferent and have their own interests and excuses. The student body here is not as militant as the one at Columbia; yet the situation exists and the time will come. University administrators here have been scared of Berkeley_æthe action has come closer to home. It is time for real communication about the University_æ_s philosophy on education, housing, the community in West Philadelphia. Or it will soon be too late. The frustration of many segments of the American population is manifesting itself in active attempts to overturn the system which causes that frustration. Further oppression and repression will only hasten the time when chaos rules a country which was founded on democratic principles!""' Perhaps we must return to democracy, return to our problems and commit ourselves to curing them. Violence and alienation are the results of indifference; we must learn from Columbia, from Memphis, from Vietnam. _æ¢ The message should be clear."

Four buildings were still being held by two student groups at Columbia University late Thursday as the protest continued against Columbia's affiliation with the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and the construction of a new gymnasium at Morningside Park. Students seized Low Memorial Library, which houses the offices of Columbia President Grayson Kirk, on Wednesday and have occupied Hamilton Hall, another administration building, since Tuesday, Late Wednesday night Avery and Fayerweather Halls were also taken. The two groups connected with the demonstration are the Student Afro-American Society (SAS) and the Students for Democracy (SDS). The primary demand of SAS is for the Immediate halt to the construction of the gym in neighboring Harlem, SDS seeks the breaking of ties with IDA. The faculty petition states as follows; We, the undersigned members of the Columbia University Faculty and teaching staff make the following proposal to resolve the present crisis. 1, We request the Trustees to implement the immediate cessation of excavation on the gymnasium site, by telephone vote if necessary, 2, We request the Administration to delegate all disciplinary power on matters related to the present crisis to the tripartite committee, consisting of students, faculty, and administration. 3, We request the students to evacuate all buildings now, and we pledge our faith and influence towards a solution. Should the students be willing to evacuate the buildings we will not meet classes until the crisis is resolved along the above lines. 4, Until the crisis is settled, we will stand before the occupied buildings to prevent forceable entry by police or others. Both SIDS and SAS are asking guaranteed amnesty for students who have barricaded themselves in the school building. SDS spokesmen have refused to negotiate any of their other five demands until the amnesty is assured. The SDS demands are: ...amnesty for the students involved in the demonstration. ...an end to the gymnasium construction. ...an end to the ties with IDA, ...dropping of disciplinary probation charges against six students involved in prior IDA demonstrations. ...open hearing by a tripartite committee on all future disciplinary action. ~.University influence to have charges dropped against those arrested by the city in gym demonstration. Columbia_æ_s faculty passed a measure Wednesday calling on the school to halt the gym construction, but suggested that the connections with IDA be maintained, that amnesty not be granted, and that the students involved in the demonstration be tried by a student-faculty-administration committee. The faculty further suggested that the structure of IDA be revised, Kirk received the faculty recommendations and indicated that he would ask the Columbia Trustees to consider them. The Trustees were attempting to obtain a quorum for a meeting late Thursday. Estimates of the students involved in the demonstration range from 250400. There are 27,500 full and parttime students at Columbia, A cordon of New York City police and Columbia security guards surrounded Low Library late Thursday, About 100 students were in the president's office Wednesday night and were joined Thursday by others who managed to evade the police. In one incident, a student attempted to scale the wall leading to Kirk's second floor office but was tackled by a leaping policeman as his hands barely reached the window ledge. He has been climbing on a window grating. Both the student and the policeman fell to the ground; the student's hands were cut, the policeman was uninjured. Several student groups organized petition both in support of and in opposition to the protesters. SDS arranged a referendum asking students to vote on the six demands. The referendum also asks student opinions on a proposed student strike in favor of the demands and on the tactics used by SDS and SAAS, The occupation of Hamilton Hall was dominated by black students. Late Wednesday students at Hamilton released acting Dean Henry Goldman who had been barricaded in his office for more than 24 hours. Wednesday students at the school of architecture staged a sit-in to protest the closing of Avery Hall, the architecture building, at 6 PJM. The building closing was postponed and eventually students were permitted to remain all night. On April 10 the faculty of the Architecture School sent a letter to Kirk asking him to reconsider the construction of the gym. There was no resistance when students occupied Avery. IDA is composed of 12 member institutions including Columbia, Princeton, MIT, and CalTech. It is governed by a Board of Trustees which includes a representative of each school. The board determines broad policies for IDA and approves research contracts. There are no IDA projects conducted at Columbia at this time but several faculty members serve as consultants to the institute. Most of the work is classified research concerning riot control measures and the development of new weapons for use in Vietnam, Demonstrators remained in the four buildings as night approached and asked sympathizers to provide candles, blankets, and food. Police allowed material supplies to be passed to these demonstrators but attempted to stop students from joining them."

There was an issue involved, but it started out as fun. First protesting. That_æ_s always a lark. Go up to an administration office and threaten to sleep there unless you get your way. A riot. Lock a dean in his office. Hilarious. Things like that aren_æ_t fun for too long. After a while, locking a dean in his office and refusing to leave a building becomes a drag. There_æ_s always action and excitement, but somehow its never the same as it was in the beginning. At Columbia last week, the fun began on Tuesday. It was serious, and there was an issue involved, an important issue. Columbia was using the expansion tactics reserved for big urban schools_æbranching out into poor neighborhoods under the guise of urban renewal and redevelopment. Columbia_æ_s blacks had every reason to be upset. The school was avoiding a middle class, relatively clean area to the west to go into Harlem and take away two-and-one-half acres of park for a $3O million gymnasium. Whites would still have Riverside Park for their playgrounds, but the blacks could afford to lose part of Morningside Park. After all, wasn_æ_t Columbia going to open a separate entrance for _æ_Community_æ? When the blacks went to the door of acting Dean Henry Coleman_æ_s office Tuesday to protest the construction of the gym, they were prepared to remain in the hallway all night. They brought blankets and all the necessary equipment, and they also brought along whites--liberal whites, members of SDS. After a while they realized that the whites just didn_æ_t belong. It was a black issue, and blacks should fight it. The blacks told the liberal whites to leave, and the SDSers cringed at the thought of being rejected._æ_We_æ_re liberal,_æ they thought. _æ_How can they do this to us?_æ The whites went to find their own building and their own issue, creating two separate furors on the normally staid Ivy League campus. Days of protest involved the capture of five buildings. After two days it became dull and as the days wore on, you began to wonder how the school_æ_s administration could let it continue. Columbia_æ_s Trustees had to handle the situation. Columbia_æ_s Trustees couldn_æ_t get together. Late Thursday afternoon, Grayson Kirk, President of the school, was futilely trying to arrange a meeting, but couldn_æ_t get enough Trustees together to get a quorum. It was almost as if they didn_æ_t care. The students did care and were prepared to stay for a long while. It wasn_æ_t all the students of course. Columbia has its apathy just as other schools do. Only about 1,000 of the 27,500 students were involved in the protest, a protest which easily could have involved the whole school if it had been planned more graciously and conducted with more dignity. But it wasn_æ_t, and Columbia _æby doing the right thing and halting construction of the gym_æappears to have been bullied by a small band of activists. Sometimes, goals can be obscured by the methods used to obtain them, no matter how righteous or good those goals may be. So it was at Columbia. Kirk and his Trustees, if they can ever get together, will have a difficult job in trying to discipline the protesters. The students themselves have suggested away out in asking for amnesty.

What many critics overlook is that the Gym would not only provide recreational facilities for Harlem youth, but it would also help to make the park safer for everyone by converting one-fifteenth of the Park_æ_s total area. In your implied approval of the students seizing buildings, you seem to feel that the end justifies the means, and that a small minority of the student body plus non-student militants have a right to disrupt classes and commit vandalism because they disagree with university policies. Even one who agrees with their objectives cannot in good faith support their tactics if he is a true member of an intellctual community; for in such a community reason--and not force _æis the means of solving problems. Violence invites counter-violence, which solves nothing. It is only through reasoned debate that lasting solutions in an intellectual community will be found. Les Schwartz Med. _æ7l Columbia _æ67"

The first point, of lesser importance, is that the Columbia Gymnasium is not being built on property where people live, but rather on land in Morningside Park, leased from New York City. While this issue raises the question of whether park land should be exploited by private interests, it demonstrates the fact that your editorial writer does not know what he is talking about. There are arguments pro and con about the appropriateness of the Morningside Park site for the Columbia Gym. These, I am sure, would bore your editorial writer, but you might consider it your responsibility to report these arguments in your columns. You apparently consider the issue important enough to merit one of your dogmatic editorials. The second point concerns the disruption of university functions. While it is true that Columbia has a record of ignoring its social responsibilities and that this poor record can and should be a focus of responsible protest, it does not follow that the educational functions of the university should be disrupted or that university officials should be held as hostages. Providing educational facilities is itself an important social function. Furthermore, (Please pardon this heresy.) protest does not mean mob action. Mobs composed of leftists are no prettier than those composed of rightists. Robert Kalter Med. _æ7l Columbia _æ67"

In a telegram to Kirk, the faculty members charged that the use of police by the University ""confesses the bankruptcy of its policies and violates the trust on which its authority is based."" ""As faculty of the University of Pennsylvania,_æ the telegram said, ""many of us with friends and some with children at Columbia, we condemn with horror the brutality that your actions have brought upon them."" The statement was originated by Dr. Dell Hymes, professor of anthropology, and Dr. Sol Worth, associate professor of communications. Worth said he learned of the police action from his daughter, a student at Columbia. The action which the telegram protested took place early Tuesday morning as police cleared five buildings in which students had been staging a sit-in. One hundred eight students and faculty members were admitted toSt, Luke_æ_s Hospital with injuries resulting from the police actions. Over 600 were arrested. In one of the buildings ""they really went in with clubs swinging,_æ Worth said. He added that the police then used horses and clubs to stampede students who had been forced to leave the academic buildings."

At its inception, the rebellion, led by Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), appeared as a small and isolated incident. As of Sunday night, however, student insurgents have occupied five campus buildings, caused the administration to close down the university, and post large numbers of police at gateways. They also seem to have won the tacit support of at least one-half of the student body and faculty. The root of the trouble lies in Columbia_æ_s decision several years ago to build a gymnasium in Morningside Park, as predominantly black recreation area in Harlem. The gym construction has been hotly debated for some time, many black groups feeling that the gym, with its separate entrances for the community, and for members of the university, is a symbol of white racism. According to James Walsh, chairman of the philosophy department and prominent member of the mediating ad hoc faculty committee, SDS stumbled on the gym issue by accident. Because the McCarthy and Kennedy campaigns have taken away its major platforms, the group has attempted to restore its diminishing membership by passing over the less flamboyant issues and concentrating on the gym question and on Columbia_æ_s connection with the Institute for Defense Analysis. IDA is a research group connected with the Pentagon. Last Tuesday, and SDS rally in front of an administration building spread to the gym construction site, whereupon several Columbia students invited local blacks to join the demonstration. The blacks later returned to the campus with the students and now occupy Hamilton Hall, where they were visited by Stokely Carmichael, and Rap Brown on Thursday. Just how much the militant blacks have pushed SDS to violent action, including the barricading of Dean John Coleman for 26 hours in his office, and the destruction of President Grayson Kirk_æ_s office, is hotly debated. Students and black dissidents have confronted the University with six demands, the first of which is amnesty. According to John Shil, a member of the student steering committee, amnesty is defined as a guarantee against the suspension or expulsion of any student demonstrator. Secondly, the students are demanding a permanent halt in the gym construction. Shil said, ""There is no doubt that the gym won_æ_t be built."" Shil also claimed that Kirk lied when he explained what IDA was doing on campus. Shil said that he had certain documents found in the president_æ_s office photocopied to prove that such research as ""contingency plans for Bolivia"" was being done at Columbia. The photocopies will be released later, according to the students. Other demands include the release of 27 people arrested in an anti-gym demonstration in February, the repeal of Kirk_æ_s ban on campus demonstrations, and the establishment of better community relations.

As the protest enters its second week, the five ""student liberated"" buildings have seen a wedding, food rationing, preparations for tear gas attack, and an astonishing variety of position papers, committee reports, and factional disputes, along with administrative compromises on every issue, except amnesty for the demonstrators. Low Library, first occupied when a mutual agreement left black students holding Hamilton Hall last Wednesday, is now surrounded by faculty who, despite the Friday morning ""police beating"" of French instructor Richard German, have successfully kept peace between the insurgents and police. The faculty are wearing light blue or purple arm bands and have stated their hope to prevent violence. Faculty Surrounded The faculty, in turn, is surrounded by a line of members from the ""majority coalition,"" a group which grew out of a Thursday meeting in which basketball coach Jack Rowan prevented an athletic rally from becoming a violent counterattack. The ""coalition"" has tried to prevent free passage of people, food, and blankets to the insurgents. A hedge and police stand between them and a milling group including food throwers (wearing green armbands signifying pro-amnesty), members of the press, and minor factions like the Committee for Defense of Property Rights who will hold a news conference tomorrow. The Committee has compared the Columbia rebels_æ_ tactics to those used by the Nazis in the 1920_æ_s and 1930_æ_s. In addition to Low Library, protestors have placed a red flag on Mathematics Hall, Fayerweather Hall (where a wedding was performed today by Protestant chaplain William Starr), Avery Hall (captured Thursday night by architecture students), and Hamilton Hall (held entirely by black students who have renamed it Malcolm X University). School Sealed Off After the appearance of Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap Brown at Hamilton Hall Friday, the school sealed off the campus to all but Columbia students, the faculty, and the press. At the time Brown said ""If the University doesn_æ_t deal with our brothers in there, they_æ_re going to have to deal with the brothers out on the street."" Black Chant Neighborhood black people are now outside the school chanting a new refrain, ""Yah, beep beep, ungaya, black power."" Theodore Kneel, a labor mediator, has also entered the dispute and is trying to reach an agreement between the administration and the insurgents. He is working out of a section of the Low Library that is not controlled by the students. It has been rumored that Kirk_æ_s Low Library office, which is controlled by students, has been rifled. The rumor has it that students have found the President_æ_s old draft card and returned it to his local draft board. The rumor has not been confirmed. Meanwhile, the tulips are blooming and Mrs. Martha Peterson yesterday was inaugurated President of Barnard. Columbia has been closed since Friday and a bewildering variety of official and unofficial proposals seem to offer little promise except continued tense stalemate."

Police Clear Buildings In four of the buildings occupied by SDS and others, eyewitnesses reported punchings, clubbings, blackjackings, kickings, draggings, and beatings by policemen and plainclothesmen directed against those students who resisted either non-violently or not at all, as well as against lines of faculty members attempting to shield the buildings from police. There were many bloodied students and a number of walking wounded on campus yesterday. The sole exception was Hamilton Hall, where members of the Student Afro-American Society (who started the uprising by occupying Hamilton last Tuesday) yielded peacefully and were led to police vans through underground tunnels. Seven hundred and twenty faculty and students were arrested and arraigned on charges including disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and rest passing. Over 100 were injured, with 78 treated in St. Luke_æ_s Hospital and an indeterminate number in Knickerbocker Hospital. All were released, students without bail and non-students with bail ranging from $100 to $500. All formal classes for today have been cancelled by a resolution passed at a meeting restricted to senior faculty yesterday at 4. The resolution, clearly a disappointment to student demonstrators, sympathizers, and a large number of faculty and students, also set today aside for faculty-student meetings in hopes of a peaceful solution. Students Seek Resignations Most of the students on campus yesterday _æ and no one was admitted who did not live in the main quadrangle of residence halls_æwere demanding the resignation of President Grayson Kirk, Vice President David B. Truman, and the members of the Board of Trustees who concurred in the decision to call in police. The student Strike Coordinating Committee has called for a general strike when the university is reopened. Two hundred faculty members have signed a petition supporting the strike. A number of faculty members, including Professor and noted literary critic Eric Bentley, and the Protestant chaplain and Jewish Rabbi, have indicated they will resign if Kirk remains as president next fall. Classes in Columbia College, which have been cancelled since Thursday night, are scheduled to resume tomorrow but remain an uncertain prospect. President Kirk sent police into the buildings after issuing the following statement: ""For nearly six days this institution has been paralyzed by the actions of a minority of its students, aided and abetted by an unknown number of outsiders. Four of our buildings have been occupied in their entirety, and my own offices and those of the provost in Low Library have been seized and our official files rifled.""_æ_These students have declined to accept any reasonable bases for settlement. They appear to have regarded the university_æ_s patience as weakness. If Columbia had been prepared to accede to the students_æ_ demands for amnesty from all disciplinary actions resulting from their illegal conduct, we would have dealt a near-fatal blow not only to this institution but to the whole of American higher education. ""Columbia_æ_s action tonight thus is not merely in the interests of its own future, but that of it_æ_s sister institutions,"" President Kirk concluded."

President Kirk maintains that yesterday_æ_s police action was necessary and in some way ""saved"" Columbia University and universities across the nation, but students and faculty seem united and agreed that the trustees and administrators who called the raid can no longer be tolerated. The students held a demonstration, but the police staged a riot. Monday night, an attempt to break through to students in Low Library provoked a fierce tug of war with athletes from the ""Majority Coalition."" Tuesday morning, after the police finished arresting the students in the buildings and turned on the crowd of press and onlookers with clubs and blackjacks, many who earlier had called for police intervention had changes of heart. ""Like Iwo Jima"" The police came from as far away as Staten Island. They included horsemen, tactical police, and plainclothesmen, who, not wearing badges or other numbered identification, did most of the beating. They came in buses like a team up for a big game. ""This is gonna be just like Iwo Jima,"" I heard one say as he practiced twirling his nightstick. His neighbor looked around and said, ""Jesus, I feel smarter already."" The hardest hit were the faculty. From the beginning they had attempted to act as a neutral force. Hoping to freeze the situation, they ringed the buildings to separate protesters and police. When the police began to mass, the ""Majority Coalition"" disbanded. The faculty remained to bear the brunt of the attack. Those attempting to leave were beaten to the ground and kicked. Two full professors, Fred Dupree and Sidney Morganbesser, were hospitalized with head injuries, and many others were beaten or dragged until unconscious and required treatment for head wounds, groin injuries, or shock. ""It was an unmitigated, gratuitous slaughter,"" said a man who had been in the Fayerweather Hall area. ""I_æ_m a faculty member, and I_æ_ll never teach here again."" Use of Violence To many, previously unconvinced or uncommitted,d Kirk_æ_s use of police violence offers strong support for the strikers criticism against university complicity with the Institute for Defense Analysis, policy on its Harlem neighborhood, and callousness toward its own students. Continued police presence can only strengthen a picture of the administration and the trustees as outside interests employing whatever means are necessary to perpetuate their control. Today, Columbia has a choice of radical change, or death. After the events of yesterday morning, few are prepared to compromise. Hopefully the students chant, ""Kirk must go!"" but they also remember the repeated shout from the paddy wagons, ""Up against the wall, mother"

Six hundred and twenty-eight people were arrested, and 103 were hospitalized. More than 100 other wounded students and faculty were treated on campus until the police, according to student observers, ordered the doctors attending to leave. Hundreds of other students, who accepted a police offer to allow any student to avoid arrest by leaving, left the confrontation after they had been forced out of the building. The three main demands of the student strikers were the following: severance of Columbias connections with the Institute of Defense Analysis (IDA), which conducts counterinsurgency and riot control research; halting the construction of a university gymnasium in Morningside Park, which had been opposed by local groups fro many years; and amnesty for all striking students. Legal Means Used The administration said it would temporarily halt construction on the gym, but refused to concede to the other demands. Student strikers and some teachers explained they had attempted to persuade the university to halt construction through legal channels and processes for many years, but that officials had refused to listen. They said this intransigence was their reason for more extreme and illegal actions. Soon after the strike started, it became well organized. Walkie-talkies were used, food was brought to strikers, thousands of leaflets were distributed, and teach-ins were held. Parietals broken Parietals were broken by hundreds of Barnard girls in the occupied buildings. A group of about 200 students opposing the sit-ins and calling themselves the ""Majority Coalition"" had strong support until the police were called in to clear the buildings. The Coalition lost ground as sentiment shifted toward the strikers. On Tuesday morning after the police raids the strikers and Columbia student leaders called for the resignation of President Kirk, Dean Truman, and members of the Board of Trustees who they felt were responsible for the police action. They also called for a general strike of the entire university, including students, teachers, and employees. Many teachers had threatened to resign if police had removed students. The faculty, which wields little power in general policy-making, was ineffective in mediating between the students and administration. At first they voted overwhelmingly to punish demonstrators. However, on Monday night 40 per cent of the faculty reversed their votes in favor of complete amnesty for the striking students. Strike Support The New York branch of the NAACP, Harlem CORE, the Morningside Tenants Committee, the Metropolitan Council on Housing, and many other groups have issued statements in support of the strikers. However, there has been a great deal of friction between Columbia and its neighboring community residents over construction of the gym. From the start most felt Mayor Lindsay had urged President Kirk not to order the police against the black students occupying Hamilton Hall because of Harlem politicians warnings of impending trouble. President Kirk was under pressure from other university presidents across the nation not to give in. They feared a successful takeover by students at one university would catalyze their own students to similar action. The one thing which was certain was that no one in the dispute would obtain a clear victory."

Contributions To IDA Columbias contributions to IDA have aided research in tactical nuclear weaponry and incendiary bombs for use in Vietnam, he charged. Clare predicted student protest against the gymnasium construction on a Harlem public park would result in ""lessened violence this summer."" Telegrams should be sent to Columbia in support of the now incarcerated students, and the Yale Administration should state its position on the Columbia takeover and arrests, the speakers contended."
